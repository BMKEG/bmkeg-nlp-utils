      <abstract>
        <p>The modification of proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) plays an important role in determining their functional properties. Importantly though, SUMOylation is a highly dynamic process enabling transient responses to be elicited. This dynamism is controlled by two competing conjugating and deconjugating activities. The latter activity is mediated by the SENP [SUMO1/sentrin/SMT3 (suppressor of mif two 3 homologue 1)-specific peptidase] family of SUMO-specific proteases. The transcription factor Elk-1 [ETS (E twenty-six)-like 1] undergoes rapid de-SUMOylation following cellular stimulation with growth factors, and this contributes to its conversion from a SUMO-dependent repressor into a potent transcriptional activator. In the present study we demonstrate an important role for SENP1 in the de-SUMOylation of Elk-1, and therefore an integral role in determining the Elk-1-dependent transcriptional programme. Among the SENPs, Elk-1 preferentially forms a complex with SENP1. This preferential binding is reflected by the higher efficiency of SENP1 in promoting Elk-1 transactivation. Moreover, depletion of SENP1 causes a reciprocal effect and reduces the transactivation properties of Elk-1. Partial redundancy of function with SENP2 is revealed by combinatorial knockdown studies. Importantly, depletion of SENP1 also reduces the activation of the Elk-1 target gene <italic>c-FOS</italic>. Taken together, these results therefore reveal an important role for SENP1 in the regulation of Elk-1-mediated gene expression in response to mitogenic signalling cues.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Protein SUMOylation is being increasingly recognized as an important post-translational modification. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins have been shown to be SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) substrates, but the majority of substrates fall into the latter class, with one major function of SUMO being in transcriptional control (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Importantly, protein SUMOylation is a dynamic process. SUMO is added to proteins through the action of an enzymatic cascade involving an E1 SUMO-activating enzyme, and the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 which transfers the SUMO to substrates. In several cases, E3 ligases can act as molecular bridges to facilitate the action of Ubc9 and promote substrate SUMOylation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Conversely, SUMOylation can be reversed through the activity of SENPs [SUMO1/sentrin/SMT3 (suppressor of mif two 3 homologue 1)-specific peptidases] which cleave SUMO from substrates (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). There are currently six known SENPs in humans, which are thought to act, in part, in distinct subnuclear structures with SENP1 and 2 localized to the nuclear pore complex and nucleoplasm, whereas SENP3 and SENP5 are localized to the nucleolus, at least under normal conditions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]).</p>
      <p>Protein SUMOylation can be controlled through the activity of protein kinase cascades in response to extracellular signals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). For example, HSF-1 (heat-shock factor-1) SUMOylation status is enhanced following heat-shock-mediated phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, SUMOylation is promoted in several other proteins following signal-dependent phosphorylation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). In contrast, following mitogen-dependent activation of the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, reduced SUMOylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 [ETS (E twenty-six)-like 1] occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. De-SUMOylation of Elk-1 is a component of the transcriptional activation process that is orchestrated by this transcription factor in response to ERK pathway signalling. In contrast, anisomycin-dependent activation of the p38 MAPK cascade does not result in Elk-1 de-SUMOylation, although the activation component of the signalling pathway still occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus Elk-1 de-SUMOylation is an important mechanism that dictates the outcome of MAPK signalling through Elk-1 and its target genes, and helps set the amplitude of the resulting transcriptional response.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we further investigated how mitogenic signalling promotes Elk-1 de-SUMOylation and hence the functional outcome in terms of target gene expression. We sought to identify which SENP is involved in the de-SUMOylation process. Through a combination of overexpression and loss-of-function approaches, we have identified SENP1 as the predominant SENP acting on Elk-1, and hence placing SENP1 as a key player in determining the transcriptional outcomes to mitogenic signalling.</p>

        <p>HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293T and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). Transfections were performed using Polyfect&#x2122; (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, then treated with PMA (10 nM) or anisomycin (250 ng/ml) prior to luciferase assays (6 h) or RT&#x2013;PCR analysis (40 min).</p>
        <p>Transfections of siRNAs were achieved using Lipofectamine&#x2122; siRNAMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon) against SENP1, SENP2, SENP3 and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were used.</p>
        <p>For reporter gene assays, typically 0.25 &#x3BC;g of reporter plasmid and 50 ng of pRL-TK-<italic>Renilla</italic> were co-transfected with 0.1&#x2013;1 &#x3BC;g of expression plasmids. Cell extracts were prepared and equal amounts of protein were used in luciferase assays using the dual-luciferase kit (Promega).

To prepare SENPs, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 30 &#x3BC;g of FLAG&#x2013;SENP1 DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were resuspended in Buffer II [25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) and Complete&#x2122; protease inhibitors (Roche), diluted 1:100] and lysed by passing them trough a 25-gauge needle. The SENP protein was purified using an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads. Beads containing the protein were washed twice in Buffer II containing 1 M NaCl and twice in Buffer II. Protein was eluted by adding FLAG peptide. Assays were carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. SUMOylated Elk-1 from 50 ml cultures was purified and kept bound to the GSH&#x2013;agarose.

        <title>Elk-1 is preferentially activated by SENP1</title>
        <p>Elk-1 is SUMO-modified and this dampens down its transactivation activity and promotes active transcriptional repression. SUMOylation is lost during the transition to a transcriptional-activating state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To begin to probe which SUMO protease(s) is involved in reversing Elk-1 SUMOylation we compared the abilities of different SUMO proteases (SENPs) to activate Elk-1 through de-SUMOylation. We first compared the expression levels of the SENPs. SENP1 and 3 were expressed at similar levels, with SENP2 being expressed to a slightly lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Next, we compared the abilities of the SENPs to activate a GAL&#x2013;Elk-1(1&#x2013;428) fusion protein in a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This fusion protein is regulated by the SUMO pathway in an analogous manner to full-length Elk-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. SENP1 had the biggest effect on Elk-1 activation, whereas SENP3 barely affected Elk-1 activity; SENP2 had an intermediary effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Owing to the reduced expression levels of SENP2, we performed a dose&#x2013;response experiment to compare the ability of SENP1 and SENP2 to activate Elk-1. However, even at 10-fold higher levels, SENP2 still activated Elk-1 to a lesser extent than SENP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, compare column 2, black bars with column 6, grey bars).</p>

        <p>The effects of the SENPs could be indirect and/or independent of their SUMO-deconjugating activities. We therefore first established whether the Elk-1 SUMOylation sites are required for SENP-mediated activation. Again, we used a luciferase reporter assay but, instead of the WT protein, we tested GAL&#x2013;Elk-1(1&#x2013;428)(K2R), which lacks the two major SUMOylation sites at Lys<sup>230</sup> and Lys<sup>249</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In comparison with WT Elk-1, Elk-1(K2R) showed much reduced activation by the SENPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), consistent with a role for SENPs in de-SUMOylating Elk-1. Conversely, we tested the activity of catalytically inactive mutant versions of the SENPs which had their active-site cysteine residues mutated. The ability of SENP1 to activate Elk-1 was much reduced, and a similar effect was seen on the smaller activation caused by SENP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). In contrast, the mutant version of SENP2 was able to activate Elk-1 to a similar extent as the WT version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), demonstrating that the activating effect of SENP2 on Elk-1 occurs by a mechanism that is independent from its SUMO-deconjugating activity.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that SENP1 is the most efficient SUMO protease acting on Elk-1, and that SENP3 has little effect on Elk-1. SENP2 has an intermediate effect, but its ability to activate Elk-1 is independent from its SUMO-deconjugating activity.</p>

        <title>SENP1 binds to Elk-1</title>
        <p>As SENP1 was established as the most efficient SUMO protease acting on Elk-1, we investigated whether we could detect complexes between these two proteins. Initial attempts at detecting interactions between Elk-1 and WT SENP1 were unsuccessful, either at endogenous or overexpressed levels. We reasoned that this might be due to the transient interactions between the enzymatic SENPs and their substrate Elk-1. Therefore, to potentially trap these interactions, we used a catalytically dead version of SENP1 (SENP1<sup>CS</sup>) in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In contrast with WT SENP1 where no complex could be detected, a complex detected between Elk-1 and the mutant SENP1<sup>CS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). Next, we compared the ability of SENP1<sup>CS</sup> and the equivalent catalytically dead mutant version of SENP2 (SENP2<sup>CS</sup>) to bind Elk-1. Preferential binding of SENP1 was observed in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). To further probe the specificity of these interactions we performed GST-pulldown assays with recombinant GST&#x2013;Elk-1 and HEK-293T cell lysates containing each of the catalytically dead SENP1&#x2013;3 enzymes. Preferential interactions were observed with SENP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>

        <title>SENP1 de-SUMOylates Elk-1</title>
        <p>The ability of SENP1 to activate Elk-1 in a SUMO-dependent manner suggests that SENP1 can de-SUMOylate Elk-1. To prove that this is the case, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> de-SUMOylation assays using recombinant SUMO-modified Elk-1 and FLAG-tagged SENP1 or SENP3 immunoprecipitated from HEK-293T cells. Elk-1 was modified by SUMO using an <italic>E. coli</italic> system containing a reconstituted SUMO pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]), and equal amounts of immunoprecipitated SENP1 and SENP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) were incubated with this recombinant protein. The addition of SENP1 resulted in loss of SUMO conjugation to Elk-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 4&#x2013;6), demonstrating that Elk-1 is a direct target of the SUMO proteolytic activity of SENP1. In contrast, little de-SUMOylation was seen upon incubation with SENP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 7&#x2013;9). Thus, in agreement with the reporter and binding assays, SENP1 and SENP3 show different activities towards Elk-1, with SENP1 more efficiently de-SUMOylating Elk-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <title>Endogenous SENP1 is important for Elk-1 activation</title>
        <p>We have established that, among SENPs, Elk-1 is preferentially activated by overexpressed SENP1 and binds specifically to SENP1. However, to determine whether endogenous SENP1 is important for Elk-1 activation, we compared the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of SENP1 with depletion of other SENPs on Elk-1 activity. First we determined the efficacy and specificity of each siRNA in depleting <italic>SENP</italic> mRNA levels. Each of the siRNA pools specifically depleted the corresponding <italic>SENP</italic> mRNA with high efficiency, with negligible effects on the other SENPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), thereby demonstrating their utility for subsequent functional assays. Next, we compared the activity of Elk-1 in a luciferase reporter assay under serum-starved conditions or upon PMA treatment. PMA treatment leads to activation of the ERK pathway and loss of SUMO on Elk-1 and hence loss of its repressive properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). In the absence of PMA, a 10% reduction in Elk-1 activity was observed following SENP1 depletion, but little effect was seen upon depleting the other SENPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, grey bars). This effect was even more pronounced in the presence of PMA, with &gt;20% reduction in Elk-1 activity seen following SENP1 depletion. Again, depletion of the other SENPs had a negligible effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, black bars). We also probed the effect of SENP depletion on the activity of the Elk-1(K2R) mutant protein that could not be SUMO-modified. In contrast with the effects seen with the WT protein, depletion of any one of the SENPs had no effect on the activity of Elk-1(K2R), either in the presence or absence of PMA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). This is consistent with a role for SENP1 in directly acting to de-SUMOylate Elk-1.</p>

        <p>Although significant, the depletion of SENP1 caused relatively small changes in the activity of Elk-1. This could be due to functional redundancy whereby, in the absence of SENP1, another SENP can at least partially substitute for its activity. To test such a possibility, a combinatorial knockdown approach was undertaken. <italic>SENP1</italic> siRNAs were used in combination with either <italic>SENP2</italic> or <italic>SENP3</italic> siRNAs. Again, SENP1 depletion caused a reduction in the activity of Elk-1 following PMA treatment, but this effect was amplified by the simultaneous depletion of SENP2, with Elk-1 activity reduced by nearly 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, grey bars). In contrast, co-depletion of SENP3 did not further enhance the activity of Elk-1, suggesting that, at the level of functional redundancy, there is still specificity of action. Again, neither the depletion of SENP1 alone nor in combination with other SENPs led to a reduction in the activity of the Elk-1(K2R) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, black bars).</p>
        <p>Taken together these results therefore demonstrate that SENP1 is the predominant SENP acting to promote Elk-1 activation in a SUMO-dependent manner, although there is a degree of functional redundancy with SENP2.</p>

        <p>Studies using reporter gene analysis suggested that a degree of functional redundancy exists between SENP1 and SENP2 which might mask the effect of SENP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Again, SENP1 depletion caused a reduction in <italic>c-FOS</italic> activation following PMA stimulation, but this effect was enhanced upon co-depletion of SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). In contrast, anisomycin-dependent <italic>c-FOS</italic> activation was unaffected by SENP1 depletion, either alone or in combination with SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>SUMOylation plays an important physiological role in determining the outcome of numerous processes in the cell. Importantly, SUMOylation is a dynamic process, enabling transient responses to be elicited, to processes such as cellular signalling events (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). However, in most cases, it is unclear how SUMO conjugation is either promoted or subsequently lost in response to signalling cues. SUMO loss is promoted by the SENPs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). In the present study, we have focussed on Elk-1 and investigated the roles of SENPs in the de-SUMOylation process. Elk-1 makes an attractive model as SUMOylation promotes its transcriptional-repressive properties and, depending on the stimulus received, SUMOylation is either retained (upon stress signalling) or lost (upon mitogenic signalling). In the present study, we identified SENP1 as a key player in the loss of SUMO from Elk-1 in response to ERK pathway signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

          <p>In the absence of ERK pathway signalling, Elk-1 is kept in a repressive state by SUMO-mediated HDAC-2 recruitment. Following ERK activation, Elk-1 is de-SUMOylated, leading to enhanced transactivation capacity, and SENP1 plays a pivotal role in this process. SRE, serum-response element.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Several lines of evidence establish SENP1 as the predominant SENP involved in Elk-1 de-SUMOylation: (i) SENP1 is the most efficient activator of Elk-1 in overexpression studies, (ii) Elk-1 binds preferentially to SENP1, (iii) SUMO-modified Elk-1 is a substrate for SENP1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, (iv) SENP1 depletion reduces the activation of Elk-1 by PMA, and (v) SENP1 depletion reduces the activation of the Elk-1 target gene <italic>c-FOS</italic> following mitogenic stimulation. Importantly, we compared the effect of several SENPs in each of the assays to demonstrate the specificity of SENP1 action. Moreover, we also verified that the effect of SENP1 was direct by determining the SUMO-dependence of its effects. SENP1-dependent activation of Elk-1 depended on its catalytic activity and the presence of SUMOylation sites in Elk-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, depletion of SENP1 only had an effect on Elk-1 activity when its SUMOylation sites were intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, SENP1 depletion only affected <italic>c-FOS</italic> activation under signalling conditions where SUMO loss is known to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are six known SENPs in humans and it is possible that some degree of functional redundancy occurs. In the present study, we only tested the effects of three different SENPs, although several assays were performed to test the role of SENP5, but this had little effect on the activity of Elk-1 or its target gene <italic>c-FOS</italic> (results not shown). It therefore remains possible that the additional SENPs SENP6 and SENP7 play a role in Elk-1 activation, maybe in a redundant manner. Nevertheless, it is clear that SENP1 plays a predominant role in Elk-1 de-SUMOylation. We do however observe functional redundancy in SENP-depletion assays where SENP2 specifically substitutes for SENP1 upon SENP loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In this scenario though, the primary role of SENP1 is probably dictated due to its stronger binding to Elk-1 than SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), thereby occluding SENP2 access to the SUMOylation sites. Only when SENP1 is lost will SENP2 be able to work on Elk-1.</p>
      <p>Binding experiments demonstrated a specific interaction between SENP1 and Elk-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, to perform such experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>, we had to use catalytically inactive versions of SENPs. The rationale behind this was that such mutants would stay associated for longer rather than merely transiently binding and dissociating following SUMO cleavage. Precedents for such behaviour exists in other enzyme&#x2013;substrate systems where, for example, p38 MAPK binding to MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor-2) could only be strongly detected using catalytically dead p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Unfortunately, this observation precluded the possibility of detecting interactions between endogenous SENP1 and Elk-1, and probably will make any such substrate&#x2013;SENP pairs difficult to detect at endogenous levels.</p>
      <p>While SENP1 is the predominant SENP involved, overexpression of SENPs has various effects on Elk-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, SENP2 and SENP3 caused smaller, yet significant, increases in Elk-1 activity. This might merely be due to overexpression and displacement of endogenous SENP1, but might also have an important role. For example, SENP3 activates Elk-1 to a small extent, and this activation might be through p300 as this was recently shown to be a physiologically relevant SENP&#x2013;substrate pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, SENP2 can activate Elk-1, but this activation appears to be largely independent from its de-SUMOylation function as the catalytically dead version activates Elk-1 as efficiently as the WT version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). It is not clear what this de-SUMOylation-independent activity of SENP2 might be, although a similar phenomenon has previously been described for the SENP2-dependent activation of c-Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The observation that SENP2 functions in a manner independent from its de-SUMOylation activity apparently contradicts its ability to substitute for SENP1 in regulating Elk-1 in a SUMO-site-dependent manner. However, it is possible that, in the case of overexpression, additional effects are triggered which would not been seen at endogenous levels, therefore interpretation of the results of these type of overexpression assays need to be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the assays do demonstrate a more potent activity of SENP1 towards Elk-1 as a SUMO protease, especially considering the alternative mode of action of SENP2 in these overexpression assays. Knockdown studies further support the role of SENP1 and more realistically delineate the potential functional redundancy of SENP2 at endogenous levels where its effects are, at least in part, elicited through its SUMO-protease activity.</p>
      <p>Initially, it was thought that de-SUMOylation would be a fairly non-specific process. However, our demonstration that Elk-1 is preferentially targeted by SENP1 provides another member of a growing list of specific SENP&#x2013;substrate interactions. Notable examples include SENP3 and p300 in response to mild oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the specific role of SENP1 in targeting HIF-1&#x3B1; (hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x3B1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and HDAC (histone deacetylase)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. At least part of the functional specificity of SENPs appears to result in their subnuclear localization, with SENP3 being localized to the nucleolus and thereby de-SUMOylating nucleolar substrates, such as nucleophosmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], although recent results demonstrate that nucleolar SENPs, such as SENP3, can be released into the nucleoplasm following mild oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, SENP1 and SENP2 are thought to be the major SENPs in the nucleoplasm, which is consistent with a role for SENP1 in controlling Elk-1 activity. It appears likely therefore that each SENP will have a specific spectrum of substrates, although some degree of functional redundancy is probably built in as a potential fail safe mechanism and subcellular localization will, to some degree, dictate the availability of substrates. It is, however, clear that the SENPs play a positive role in determining the dynamics and functional outcome of protein SUMOylation.</p>
