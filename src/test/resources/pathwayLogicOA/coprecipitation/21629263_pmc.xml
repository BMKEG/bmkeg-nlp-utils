      <abstract>
        <p>Transforming growth factor &#x3B2; (TGF&#x3B2;) is a pluripotent cytokine promoting epithelial cell plasticity during morphogenesis and tumour progression. TGF&#x3B2; binding to type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (T&#x3B2;RII and T&#x3B2;RI) causes activation of different intracellular signaling pathways. T&#x3B2;RI is associated with the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Here we show that TGF&#x3B2;, via TRAF6, causes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI, promoting cleavage of T&#x3B2;RI by TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), in a PKC&#x3B6;-dependent manner. The liberated intracellular domain (ICD) of T&#x3B2;RI associates with the transcriptional regulator p300 to activate genes involved in tumour cell invasiveness, such as <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>MMP2.</italic> Moreover, TGF&#x3B2;-induced invasion of cancer cells is TACE- and PKC&#x3B6;- dependent and the T&#x3B2;RI ICD is localized in the nuclei of different kinds of tumour cells in tissue sections. Thus, our data reveal a specific role for T&#x3B2;RI in TGF&#x3B2; mediated tumour invasion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Transforming growth factor &#x3B2; (TGF&#x3B2;) is a cytokine which plays an important role during normal embryogenesis due to its multifunctional effects on cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration. In recent years TGF&#x3B2; has become recognized as a potent regulator of cellular plasticity which is a central event during embryogenesis and tumour progression. TGF&#x3B2; signals through its binding to the type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (T&#x3B2;RII and T&#x3B2;RI, respectively), to cause their hetero-oligomerization which subsequently activates different intracellular signaling pathways. T&#x3B2;RI phosphorylates the latent transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 in early endosomes, to induce complex formation with Smad4 and nuclear translocation to regulate target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. T&#x3B2;RI has been found to harbour a consensus binding site for the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6); upon TGF&#x3B2; binding TRAF6 activates the TGF&#x3B2; activated kinase 1 (TAK1)&#x2014;p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Interestingly, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) has recently been shown to cleave T&#x3B2;RI in its extracellular domain, which was demonstrated to cause a loss of TGF&#x3B2;-induced inhibition of proliferation of cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>Posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as monoubiquitination or Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, have emerged as an important mechanism to control the localization or function of the protein, whereas Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of proteins instead targets its substrate for proteasomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. TRAF6 is known to induce Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of its substrates, including TAK1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>The underlying molecular mechanisms for how TGF&#x3B2; can both act as a tumour suppressor and a promoter remain to be fully understood. To further address how TGF&#x3B2; promotes tumour progression, we have investigated the possibility that TRAF6 regulates the subcellular localization of T&#x3B2;RI by Lys63-dependent polyubiquitination and whether this is related to the capability of TGF&#x3B2; to facilitate tumour invasion. We report here that TGF&#x3B2; uses TRAF6, PKC&#x3B6; and TACE to promote the formation of an intracellular domain (ICD) of the T&#x3B2;RI that is translocated to the nucleus, where it promotes tumour invasion by induction of <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>MMP2</italic>.</p>

        <title>Nuclear accumulation of the intracellular domain of T&#x3B2;RI</title>
        <p>To investigate whether T&#x3B2;RI is proteolytically cleaved in human prostate cancer (PC-3U) cells, we ectopically expressed a C-terminally tagged constitutively active (ca) T&#x3B2;RI (HA-ALK5TD). Notably, in addition to the full length receptor, the HA antibody recognized a smaller fragment, corresponding to the estimated size of the intracellular part of T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we next investigated the subcellular localization of endogenous T&#x3B2;RI in PC-3U cells visualized by a antibodies raised against its intracellular, C-terminal part (V22) or its extracellular N-terminal part (H100; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). An enhanced nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI, or its C-terminal fragment, was noticed in TGF&#x3B2;-stimulated PC-3U cells, upon staining with the V22 antibody. In contrast, immunofluorescence staining revealed that the extracellular domain of the receptor, visualized by the H100-antibody was mainly localized in the cell membrane in PC-3U cells stimulated with TGF&#x3B2; for 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To ensure the specificity of the V22 antibody in immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, siRNA was used to knock-down endogenous T&#x3B2;RI expression in PC-3U cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>); qRT-PCR was also used to demonstrate a substantial decrease of T&#x3B2;RI mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). The specificity of the V22 antibody used in our study was also verified by peptide blocking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further validate the observation that T&#x3B2;RI, or its intracellular domain (ICD), is translocated to the nucleus in a TGF&#x3B2;-dependent manner, we performed a nuclear fractionation assay of cell lysates from TGF&#x3B2;-treated PC-3U cells. Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts by the V22 antibody revealed a T&#x3B2;RI fragment of approximally 34 kDa, which was not recognized by the H100 antibody raised against the N-terminal part of T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, full-length T&#x3B2;RI was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction, both by the V22 and H100 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). While a pronounced increase of nuclear T&#x3B2;RI was detected by immunofluorescence only after TGF&#x3B2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), nuclear T&#x3B2;RI was detected by immunoblotting also in the absence of TGF&#x3B2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that sensitivity for detection of nuclear T&#x3B2;RI is higher with the nuclear fractionation assay. To further investigate the TGF&#x3B2;-dependency of nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI, we expressed a fusion protein in which GFP was linked to the C-terminal part of T&#x3B2;RI in PC-3U cells. The GFP-tagged T&#x3B2;RI entered the nucleus of PC-3U cells after stimulation with TGF&#x3B2; for 6 h, while GFP expressed from a vector containing GFP alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also investigated the nuclear localization of ectopically expressed C-terminally HA-tagged ca T&#x3B2;RI in PC-3U cells and observed a TGF&#x3B2;-induced accumulation of the HA-tagged ca T&#x3B2;RI-ICD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>). This observation is consistent with the nuclear accumulation of endogenous T&#x3B2;RI-ICD as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a,b</xref>. In further support of the notion that the N-terminal part of the T&#x3B2;RI did not enter the nucleus, a HA-tagged T&#x3B2;RI with the tag localized N-terminally between amino acid residues 27 and 28<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, was found not to enter the nucleus in PC-3U cells with or without treatment with TGF&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1e</xref>). Moreover, no TGF&#x3B2;-induced increase of the T&#x3B2;RI-ICD for N-terminal HA-tagged T&#x3B2;RI was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1f</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI enters into the nucleus in PC-3U cells in response to TGF&#x3B2; stimulation.</p>

        <title>Nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI is dependent on TRAF6</title>
        <p>We have recently identified a consensus binding site for TRAF6 in T&#x3B2;RI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Ligand-induced oligomerization of the TGF&#x3B2; receptor complex results in receptor kinase-independent activation of the enzymatic activity of TRAF6. This in turn causes Lys63-polyubiquitin-dependent activation of TGF&#x3B2;-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), causing activation of p38 MAPK in PC-3U cells. In contrast, activation of the canonical Smad pathway does not require TRAF6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. To examine whether TRAF6 is important for the cleavage and nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI, we expressed C-terminally HA-tagged wild-type (wt) caT&#x3B2;RI (HA-T&#x3B2;RI) or the HA-tagged caE161A (HA-E161A) receptor mutant which is unable to bind TRAF6, but still causes activation of the canonical Smad signalling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>, stimulation of cells with TGF&#x3B2; resulted in Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of wt T&#x3B2;RI, but not of the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI. Cleavage of the wt T&#x3B2;RI, as observed by immunoblotting of total cell lysate with HA antiserum was found to associate with its Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI failed to activate the p38 MAPK pathway while it was still able to activate Smad2, consistent with our previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, knock-down of endogenous TRAF6 in PC-3U cells by siRNA, also resulted in loss of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI, as well as loss of the formation of the T&#x3B2;RI ICD in response to stimulation with TGF&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a,b</xref>). By using either Lys63 or Lys48 polyubiquitin-specific antibodies, we found that wt T&#x3B2;RI was Lys63-polyubiquitinated after 30 min of TGF&#x3B2; stimulation, while no obvious sign of TGF&#x3B2;-induced Lys48-polyubiqutination of T&#x3B2;RI, was observed in this cell line during this time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a,c</xref>).</p>
        <p>The pattern of polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI was further examined using HA-tagged wt or mutant ubiquitin overexpressed in PC-3U cells. TGF&#x3B2; stimulation induced polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI in PC-3U cells transiently transfected with a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysine residues where mutated except Lys63, while reduced ubiquitination was seen when a similar mutant retaining only Lys48 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, TRAF6 was shown to induce the polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay, providing firm evidence that T&#x3B2;RI is a substrate for TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>TGF&#x3B2;-induced nuclear accumulation of ectopically expressed C-terminal HA-tagged caT&#x3B2;RI in PC-3U cells occurred more efficiently for the wt T&#x3B2;RI than for the E161A mutant HA-T&#x3B2;RI, as analyzed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). On the basis of these data, we conclude that TRAF6 causes Lys63-dependent polyubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI in a TGF&#x3B2;-dependent manner which correlates with generation of an intracellular fragment of T&#x3B2;RI and its nuclear accumulation.</p>

        <title>T&#x3B2;RI is cleaved by TACE</title>
        <p>The metalloproteases TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE)/ADAM17 and ADAM10, when activated, cleave certain receptors and adhesion proteins, just outside the cell membrane. TACE has recently been shown to cleave T&#x3B2;RI in an ERK MAP-kinase dependent manner, leading to desensitization of TGF&#x3B2; signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. TACE is often overexpressed in tumours and is activated by PKC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms behind the cleavage and nuclear translocation of T&#x3B2;RI, we examined the possible involvement of the metalloproteinase TACE/ADAM17. Treatment of human PC-3U cells with TPA to activate PKC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> led to nuclear accumulation of endogenous T&#x3B2;RI or its ICD, as shown by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Moreover, when PC-3U cells expressing the C-terminally tagged HA-caT&#x3B2;RI were treated with TGF&#x3B2; or TPA, the ICD accumulated in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Pretreatment of cells with TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TACE, led to a decreased nuclear entrance of the ICD of endogenous T&#x3B2;RI in response to TGF&#x3B2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).

A TGF&#x3B2;-induced colocalization of T&#x3B2;RI and TACE was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>).

        <title>Determination of the TACE cleavage site in T&#x3B2;RI</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that TACE has a strong preference for cleavage at Ala-Val sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> or Gly-Leu sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. T&#x3B2;RI contains two Gly-Leu sequences, located at position Gly52 and Gly120. To investigate the possibility that TACE cleaves T&#x3B2;RI at Gly120, which is located close to the transmembrane domain, we mutated Gly 120 to Ile (G120I) in T&#x3B2;RI. The G120I mutant T&#x3B2;RI did not undergo cleavage in response to TGF&#x3B2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting that TACE cleaves T&#x3B2;RI at the Gly-Leu bond at position 120&#x2013;121. The kinase activity of the G120I mutant was intact as judged by its ability to phosphorylate Smad2, when compared with wt T&#x3B2;RI. Moreover, the G120I mutant T&#x3B2;RI did not accumulate in the nucleus in response to TGF&#x3B2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

However, we found that PKC&#x3B6; is activated as a result of stimulation of cells by TGF&#x3B2;, as well as by TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). TGF&#x3B2; stimulation did not lead to activation of PKC&#x3B6; in TRAF6<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), supporting the notion that TRAF6 is important for TGF&#x3B2;-induced activation of PKC&#x3B6;. Using a nuclear fractionation assay, we noticed a significant loss of TGF&#x3B2;-induced nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI ICD after siRNA-mediated silencing of PKC&#x3B6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In addition, ectopic expression of wt PKC&#x3B6; promoted expression and cleavage of caT&#x3B2;RI or kinase dead (KD) T&#x3B2;RI mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Treatment of PC-3U cells with the PKC&#x3B6; inhibitor decreased the formation of the ICD of C-terminally HA-tagged ca T&#x3B2;RI in TGF&#x3B2;-treated cells as well as in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b,c</xref>), while treatment with the T&#x3B2;RI kinase inhibitor SB505124 had no major effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using immunofluorescence stainings, we observed TGF&#x3B2;-induced co-localization of endogenous T&#x3B2;RI and TACE.

        <title>T&#x3B2;RI ICD regulates transcription</title>
        <p>The observation that the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI enters the nucleus in TGF&#x3B2;-treated PC-3U cells, suggests that it might participitate in gene regulation. To search for a link between the nuclear T&#x3B2;RI ICD and gene transcription, we investigated if T&#x3B2;RI ICD associates with the well-known transcriptional regulator p300. TGF&#x3B2; treatment of PC-3U cells led to a co-localization of T&#x3B2;RI and p300 in nuclear specles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), which we identified by co-immunofluorescence as promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Treatment of cells with the PKC&#x3B6; pseudosubstrate prevented the co-localization of T&#x3B2;RI with PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the acetyltransferase p300 was found to associate with T&#x3B2;RI ICD <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>) and we used an acetyl-lysine antibody to verify that T&#x3B2;RI ICD is acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). In contrast, in cells expressing the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI, less ICD was associated with endogenous p300 and less acetylated ICD was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). We observed that the level of p300 was lower in cells transfected with the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI unable to bind TRAF6, compared to wt T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Using qRT-PCR, a TGF&#x3B2;-induced increase of p300 mRNA expression was observed in cells transiently transfected with wt T&#x3B2;RI, but not in cells transfected with E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). This suggests that TGF&#x3B2; induces p300 in a TRAF6-dependent manner.</p>
        <p>Next, we used qRT-PCR to analyze the effect of T&#x3B2;RI ICD on known TGF&#x3B2; target genes. <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>MMP2</italic> mRNA expressions were induced by wt T&#x3B2;RI but much less by the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI, whereas <italic>PAI1</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> were induced by both wt and E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>). A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed binding of T&#x3B2;RI or T&#x3B2;RI ICD to the endogenous <italic>Snail</italic> promoter in a TGF&#x3B2;-dependent manner in PC-3U cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). Since expression of <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>MMP2</italic> genes is linked to tumour invasiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we examined PC-3U cells expressing wt or E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI using an invasion assay. Interestingly, we observed that TGF&#x3B2;-induced invasion occurred in PC-3U cells only when wt T&#x3B2;RI was expressed, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated invasion both in cells expressing wt or mutant T&#x3B2;RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6i</xref>, right panel shows optical density (OD) mean values of stained invasive tumour cells). Similar results were observed when the experiment was repeated using the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP; TGF&#x3B2; treatment of LNCaP cells expressing wt T&#x3B2;RI, but not the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI, promoted their invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a,b</xref>). Thus, our data propose that the T&#x3B2;RI ICD associates with p300 in nuclear PML bodies in a PKC&#x3B6;-dependent manner, and is acetylated by p300. Moreover, <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>MMP2</italic> are induced by T&#x3B2;RI ICD, correlating with an increased invasiveness of cells.</p>

By using confocal imaging, we found that TGF&#x3B2; treatment of MDA-MB-231 also promotes accumulation of endogenous ICD of T&#x3B2;RI in the nucleus, in a TACE- and PKC&#x3B6;- dependent manner, which was found to be associated with the TGF&#x3B2;-induced invasiveness of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have provided evidence that T&#x3B2;RI undergoes cleavage by TACE in cancer cells and that the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI is translocated to the nucleus where it associates with the transcriptional regulator p300 in nuclear PML bodies. Accumulation of the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI in the nucleus occurs after TGF&#x3B2; stimulation and is dependent on TRAF6, TACE and PKC&#x3B6;. The expression levels of Smads did not influence the PKC&#x3B6;-dependent generation of the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI as knock down of Smad4 by siRNA, had no effect on the PKC&#x3B6;-induced generation of T&#x3B2;RI ICD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>). Neither did overexpression of Smad2, 3 or 4 in PC-3U cells affect PKC&#x3B6;-induced generation of T&#x3B2;RI ICD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>). Since the TRAF6-binding deficient T&#x3B2;RI mutant (HA-E161A) still activates Smad2, while generation of the T&#x3B2;RI ICD is impaired, it appears that the canonical Smad pathway can operate independently of the generation of the T&#x3B2;RI ICD, which instead correlates with activation of the TRAF6&#x2014;TAK1&#x2014;p38 MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
      <p>Integrins are essential adhesion receptors which are involved in cell migration and extracelullar matrix assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. TGF&#x3B2;-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway has been demonstrated to be related to integrin signaling and implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in certain cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. To investigate a possible relationship between integrin signaling and TGF&#x3B2;-induced generation of T&#x3B2;RI ICD, we used antibodies which promotes or inhibits integrin activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (TS2 and CD29 antibodies, respectively). No major effects on TGF&#x3B2;-induced formation of the T&#x3B2;RI ICD was observed, when integrins were activated or inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Exactly how T&#x3B2;RI ICD is translocated to the nucleus is the topic of our ongoing investigations. Interestingly, our finding that the ICD of T&#x3B2;RI associates with p300 and the Snail promoter, to support transcriptional regulation of a subset of genes, including <italic>Snail</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>p300</italic>, correlates with increased invasiveness of cells. Whether the Smad proteins also participitate in the transcriptional complexes is an interesting possibility that remains to be elucidated. Nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI was observed in prostate, breast and lung cancer cells and also in several cancer tissues, but not in primary prostate epithelial cells. Thus the pathway elucidated in this report occurs in different kinds of human tumours and could contribute to tumour progression. Taken together, our data support the notion that the cleavage and nuclear accumulation of T&#x3B2;RI is part of a tumour promoting TGF&#x3B2; signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>Histology of human tumours</title>
        <p>Tissue microarrays (TMAs) of malignant tissues, containing multiple samples from different patients with prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer produced by the Human Proteome Atlas (HPA) facility (http://www.proteinatlas.org) were stained using anti-T&#x3B2;RI antibodies (V22 and H100). Pictures of stained TMA sections were taken with an ALTRA 20 soft imaging system and an Olympus BX45 microscope. Ethical permit to use decoded, tumour tissues for generation of tissue slides or TMA was granted by the Uppsala ethical review board in full agreement with the Swedish Ethical Review Act.</p>

        <title>TRAF6 promotes Lys63-dependent polyubiquitination of wt T&#x3B2;RI but not of the E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) PC-3U cells transiently transfected with C-terminally HA-tagged wt T&#x3B2;RI, or E161A mutant T&#x3B2;RI deficient in association with TRAF6, were treated or not with TGF&#x3B2;, whereafter ubiquitination of T&#x3B2;RI was examined by an <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assay. Complexes immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibodies were immunoblotted (IB) with Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin-specific antibody. A light-chain specific secondary antiserum was used to avoid cross-reaction with IgG heavy chain. Molecular weight markers are indicated. Another part of the corresponding total cell lysates (TCL) was subjected to immunoblotting for HA to detect the T&#x3B2;RI-ICD fragment, and activation of p38 and Smad2, by phospho-specific antisera. The filters were then reprobed with total p38 or Smad2, to verify specificity of phospho-specific antisera and actin served as internal control for equal loading of proteins. (<bold>b</bold>) <italic>In vivo</italic> ubiquitination assays performed in PC-3U cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged wt, K63- and K48-only ubiquitin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with V22 antibody against T&#x3B2;RI, and K63-dependent polyubiquitination was visualized by immunoblotting with P4D1-antiserum. A light-chain specific secondary antiserum was used to avoid cross-reaction with IgG heavy chain. The TCL-filter was subjected to immunoblotting with an HA-antibody to verify equal expression levels of ubiquitin. (<bold>c</bold>) PC-3U cells ectopically expressing C-terminally HA-tagged wt T&#x3B2;RI or the corresponding E161A mutant were stimulated with TGF&#x3B2; for 0.5 h and thereafter stained with an HA antibody.
