        <p>Continuous adhesion formation and disassembly (adhesion turnover) in the protrusions of migrating cells is regulated by unclear mechanisms. We show that p21-activated kinase (PAK)&#x2013;induced phosphorylation of serine 273 in paxillin is a critical regulator of this turnover. Paxillin-S273 phosphorylation dramatically increases migration, protrusion, and adhesion turnover by increasing paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding and promoting the localization of a GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK signaling module near the leading edge. Mutants that interfere with the formation of this ternary module abrogate the effects of paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. PAK-dependent paxillin-S273 phosphorylation functions in a positive-feedback loop, as active PAK, active Rac, and myosin II activity are all downstream effectors of this turnover pathway. Finally, our studies led us to identify in highly motile cells a class of small adhesions that reside near the leading edge, turnover in 20&#x2013;30 s, and resemble those seen with paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. These adhesions appear to be regulated by the GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK module near the leading edge.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration is a spatiotemporally regulated process marked by the formation and disassembly of adhesions, which are complex supramolecular structures that connect the extracellular matrix to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schoenwaelder and Burridge, 1999</xref>). In the front of migrating cells, the continuous formation and disassembly of adhesions (adhesion turnover) is highly regulated and appears to be coupled to protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Although several regulators of adhesion turnover, including paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>), G protein&#x2013;coupled receptor kinase&#x2013;interacting protein 1 (GIT1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>), FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ren et al., 2000</xref>), Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>), and p21-activated kinase (PAK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manser et al., 1997</xref>) are known, how these molecules act together to regulate adhesion turnover is not clear.</p><p>Paxillin is a key regulator of adhesion turnover, as it interacts with several adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Turner, 2004</xref>) through its five NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal LD domains, four COOH-terminal LIM domains, and multiple SH3 and SH2 binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turner, 2000</xref>). The LD4 domain of paxillin binds FAK and GIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Turner, 2004</xref>) and is implicated in adhesion turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Paxillin targets GIT1 to the leading edge and adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manabe et al., 2002</xref>), and GIT1 overexpression sequesters paxillin from adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>), implicating this interaction in adhesion disassembly. Cells expressing an LD4-deletion paxillin mutant show perturbed migration and protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">West et al., 2001</xref>). Also, GIT1 is a key regulator of protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manabe et al., 2002</xref>), raising the possibility that the paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 interaction may regulate and thus link adhesion turnover and protrusion formation.</p><p>GIT1, through its Spa2 homology domain (SHD), binds to the Rac exchange factor PAK-interactive exchange factor (PIX), which in turn binds the Rac effector PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manser et al., 1998</xref>), forming a trimolecular GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manabe et al., 2002</xref>). GIT1 functions in part by targeting PIX and PAK to different subcellular zones (e.g., adhesions and the leading edge) in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manabe et al., 2002</xref>). This module is also implicated in neuronal synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) and immunological synapse organization through local Rac and PAK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phee et al., 2005</xref>). PAK is also implicated in adhesion stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>) through its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manser et al., 1997</xref>), and the PIX&#x2013;PAK complex is required for protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cau and Hall, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation is a likely mechanism by which paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding is regulated, as it regulates the interaction of paxillin with other binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishibe et al., 2003</xref>). We recently identified a novel phosphorylation site at serine residue 273 in paxillin (S273-paxillin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Webb et al., 2005</xref>) that resides in its LD4 domain and thus can potentially regulate paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding. We show that S273-paxillin phosphorylation is PAK-mediated and up-regulates adhesion turnover and protrusion by increasing paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding and Rac activation. It also targets the components of the GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK module near the leading edge to a population of small and highly dynamic adhesions. These adhesions exhibit very fast turnover and differ substantially in size and location from the adhesions studied earlier. Also, PAK activation is required for faster adhesion turnover and protrusion dynamics downstream of S273-paxillin phosphorylation through myosin. Collectively, we demonstrate a novel positive-feedback mechanism that regulates and couples adhesion and protrusion dynamics through the localization of a pax&#x2013;GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PAK-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin at S273 regulates its interaction with GIT1</title><p>We recently used mass spectrometry to identify several utilized phosphorylation sites on paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). Of these, S273 lies within the LD4 domain, and therefore its phosphorylation could regulate paxillin binding to FAK or GIT1. To determine whether S273-paxillin phosphorylation occurs in CHO-K1 cells, we assessed S273-paxillin phosphorylation in lysates prepared from CHO-K1 cells plated under migration-promoting conditions (see Materials and methods) by immunoblotting using a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;specific antibody that recognized phosphomimetic S273D-paxillin but not nonphosphorylatable S273A-paxillin (Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509075/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509075/DC1</ext-link>). Phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody specificity was confirmed by phosphopeptide competition (Fig. S1 b). We observed a single band corresponding to the molecular mass of paxillin (&#x223C;68 kD) in lysates treated with CalyculinA (a Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor), with no detectable signal in untreated lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>), suggesting that S273-paxillin is a labile phosphorylation site. During cell spreading, S273-paxillin phosphorylation was detected at low levels in suspended cells with an increase after 1 h of spreading until 3.5 h (Fig. S1, c and d).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>S273-paxillin phosphorylation by PAK regulates paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding.</bold> (a) CHO-K1 lysates treated (right) and untreated (left) with 5 nM CalyculinA (CalA) were probed (top) using a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;specific antibody. Total paxillin levels were assayed with an anti-paxillin antibody (bottom). A single band corresponding to the molecular mass of paxillin (&#x223C;68 kD) was detected in treated lysates. (b) Kinase assay was performed with FLAG-WT-paxillin and either KD- or CA-myc-PAK synthesized in vitro, and S273-paxillin phosphorylation was assessed with a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody. Bottom blots show equal loading by probing with anti-FLAG and anti-myc antibodies, respectively. Phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin levels increased eightfold with CA-PAK compared with KD-PAK. (c) Paxillin was immunoprecipitated using a GFP antibody from CHO-K1 lysates expressing paxillin-GFP and either KD- or CA-myc-PAK, and S273-paxillin phosphorylation levels were assayed using a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody. The lower two panels show equal levels of paxillin&#x2013;GFP and myc-PAK, and the GFP blot shows equal loading in the lysates. S273-paxillin phosphorylation increased eightfold with CA-PAK as compared with KD-PAK. (d) A GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate paxillin from CHO-K1 lysates expressing GFP control or WT-, S273A-, or S273D-paxillin-GFP and FLAG-GIT1. GIT1 binding was probed using an anti-FLAG antibody. The bottom two panels show equivalent expression of S273-paxillin mutants and FLAG-GIT1 in the lysates. GIT1 binding to S273D-paxillin increased threefold, whereas it was reduced twofold with S273A-paxillin, when compared with WT-paxillin. (e) Paxillin was immunoprecipitated from CHO-K1 lysates expressing GFP control or WT-, S273A-, or S273D-paxillin-GFP and myc-FAK using a GFP antibody, and FAK binding was assessed with an anti-myc antibody. The bottom two panels show equivalent expression of S273-paxillin mutants and myc-FAK in the lysates. S273-paxillin phosphorylation only marginally affected FAK binding. (f) GIT1 was immunoprecipitated from in vitro mixtures of FLAG-GIT1, untagged WT-paxillin, and either KD- or CA-PAK using anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose, and phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin binding was probed using a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody. The middle blot shows equal levels of FLAG-GIT1 using an anti-FLAG antibody. (bottom) Equal loading of the lysates using anti-myc and anti-paxillin antibodies, respectively. Phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding increased sevenfold with CA-PAK compared with KD-PAK. (g) Anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose was used to immunoprecipitate GIT1 from in vitro mixtures of FLAG-GIT1, untagged WT-paxillin, and CA-PAK preincubated with 500-fold molar excess of phospho&#x2013; or nonphospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin peptide, and phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin binding was assessed with a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody. Very low levels of phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding was detected with the competitive phosphopeptide (left), whereas a robust signal was observed with the noncompetitive peptide (right), confirming that the PAK-mediated increase in phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding is specific to S273-paxillin phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1730587f01"/></fig><p>Paxillin is a substrate of PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hashimoto et al., 2001</xref>), and the LD4 domain (N-LDELMAS*L-C) has a glutamic acid residue four residues upstream of S273; from peptide studies, this is a favored recognition determinant for PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tuazon et al., 1997</xref>). To determine whether S273-paxillin is phosphorylated by PAK, we performed a kinase assay with in vitro&#x2013;synthesized FLAG-paxillin and either myc-tagged, kinase-dead (KD), or constitutively active (CA) PAK and assayed phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin levels by immunoblotting using the phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibodies. Low levels of phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin were detected with KD-PAK, whereas a robust signal (eightfold increase) was observed with CA-PAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). We also observed a similar eightfold increase in S273-paxillin phosphorylation when paxillin-GFP was immunoprecipitated from CHO-K1 cells coexpressing wild-type (WT)&#x2013;paxillin-GFP and KD- or CA-myc-PAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assayed the binding of the S273-paxillin mutants with FAK and GIT1. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated from CHO-K1 cells coexpressing either WT-, S273D-, or S273A-paxillin-GFP and FLAG-GIT1 or myc-FAK. Similar levels of expression for paxillin-GFP and FLAG-GIT1 or myc-FAK were confirmed from immunoblots of the lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, d and e). GIT1 or FAK binding was assessed by immunoblotting. GIT1 binding to S273D-paxillin increased about threefold, whereas it decreased twofold with S273A-paxillin, compared with WT-paxillin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). In contrast, FAK binding changed modestly, if any, increasing by 25.0 &#xB1; 8.0% (P &lt; 0.05) with S273A-paxillin and decreasing to 73.0 &#xB1; 3.0% (P &lt; 0.01) with S273D-paxillin, compared with WT-paxillin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>). To confirm the differential binding of phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin to GIT1, using an in vitro expression system, we synthesized FLAG-GIT1, untagged WT-paxillin, and myc-tagged KD- or CA-PAK. We then immunoprecipitated GIT1 and assessed the amount of phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin bound to GIT1 by immunoblotting. There was a sevenfold increase in the level of phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin bound to FLAG-GIT1 in the presence of CA-versus KD-PAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we probed using an anti-paxillin antibody (unpublished data). This effect was specific because incubation with a phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin peptide abolished phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin&#x2013;GIT1 binding, whereas the nonphospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin peptide had no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that S273-paxillin phosphorylation is directly mediated by PAK and regulates binding of paxillin to GIT1.</p></sec><sec><title>S273-paxillin phosphorylation increases cell migration and protrusive activity</title><p>The functional significance of S273-paxillin phosphorylation was determined by assaying its effects on cell migration. The migration rates for S273A-paxillin&#x2013;expressing CHO-K1 cells showed a &gt;40% decrease (20.0 &#xB1; 2.0 &#x3BC;m/h; <italic>n</italic> = 30), whereas they increased by nearly 30% (45.0 &#xB1; 3.0 &#x3BC;m/h; <italic>n</italic> = 30; P &lt; 0.01) for S273D-paxillin, compared with WT-paxillin (35.0 &#xB1; 3.0 &#x3BC;m/h; <italic>n</italic> = 30; P &lt; 0.0001). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref> shows the individual cell tracks of CHO-K1 cells expressing WT-, S273A-, or S273D-paxillin transposed to a common origin. When compared with WT-paxillin, S273A-paxillin&#x2013;expressing CHO-K1 cells displayed shorter migration paths. In contrast, the migration paths of cells expressing S273D-paxillin were significantly longer. We also assayed the protrusiveness of S273D-paxillin&#x2013;expressing cells that formed many protrusions (unpublished data), unlike S273A-paxillin&#x2013;expressing cells. Protrusion rates, as assayed by kymography (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hinz et al., 1999</xref>), increased sevenfold (10.6 &#xB1; 1.3 &#x3BC;m/min) and reduced threefold (0.5 &#xB1; 0.1 &#x3BC;m/min) with S273D- and S273A-paxillin, respectively, when compared with WT-paxillin (1.5 &#xB1; 0.2 &#x3BC;m/min; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>). The protrusion stability increased twofold (42.0 &#xB1; 5.0 min) and decreased slightly for S273A- and S273D-paxillin (17.0 &#xB1; 2.0 min), respectively, compared with WT-paxillin (22.0 &#xB1; 3.0 min; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 d</xref>). Therefore, S273-paxillin phosphorylation regulates the migration and protrusive activity of CHO-K1 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>S273-paxillin phosphorylation increases cell migration and protrusiveness.</bold> (a) Wind rose plots for CHO-K1 cells expressing WT-, S273A- or S273D-paxillin-GFP.

Previous studies implicate FAK, Src, and paxillin in the regulation of adhesion turnover, as <italic>FAK</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>, <italic>SYF</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>, and <italic>pxl</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> cells exhibit impaired adhesion disassembly, protrusion, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). We describe a novel PAK-mediated phosphorylation pathway that accelerates adhesion turnover and protrusion dynamics in migrating cells. Phosphorylation of paxillin on S273 by PAK promotes the localization of a signaling module containing the adaptor GIT1, the Rac GEF PIX, and the active form of the Rac effector PAK to a region near the leading edge. We conclude that PAK acts both upstream and downstream of S273-paxillin phosphorylation, in a positive-feedback loop, providing a mechanism for adhesion&#x2013;protrusion coupling.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the pax&#x2013;GIT1&#x2013;PIX&#x2013;PAK module localizes Rac activity near the leading edge through the joint presence of PIX and PAK. This is consistent with previous studies that show Rac localization near the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kraynov et al., 2000</xref>) and our own observation that Rac activation and cycling is required for rapid adhesion turnover. Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> also implicate a positive role for paxillin in the regulation of Rac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, recent evidence shows that the Rac-dependent spatial localization of protrusive activity is mediated by active PAK through the recruitment of PIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cau and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that active PAK is a key effector for fast adhesion turnover and protrusion dynamics after S273-paxillin phosphorylation. These observations are consistent with previous studies that have hinted at a role for PAK in adhesion stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manser et al., 1997</xref>) and shown active PAK localization near the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sells et al., 2000</xref>). We have extended these observations by clarifying the function and location of active PAK, demonstrating its direct role in adhesion turnover, and providing a pathway for regulating its localization.</p><p>How does PAK regulate the rapid turnover of the highly dynamic adhesions? The inhibition of adhesion turnover by blebbistatin suggests that myosin is a major effector. PAK is known to affect myosin activity both by inhibiting MLC kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>) and through the direct phosphorylation of MLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chew et al., 1998</xref>). Although the ATPase activity of myosin II generates contractile forces that are thought to mediate adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>), there is also evidence that such contractility is involved in adhesion disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley and Horwitz, 1995</xref>). Thus, there are several possibilities for myosin-mediated regulation of adhesion turnover.</p><p>The effect of PAK on protrusion also has multiple possibilities. A likely candidate is its effector LIM kinase, which regulates actin dynamics by inactivating actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>). Modulating adhesion to the substratum is another possibility, as net protrusion is thought to result from the balance between actin treadmilling, retrograde actin flow, and the interaction of the actin filaments with adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988</xref>). Increased interaction with adhesions leads to more traction, less retrograde flow, and, hence, higher protrusion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin and Forscher, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Although our results show a positive regulatory role for GIT1 at the leading edge, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nishiya et al., 2005</xref>) in &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub> integrin&#x2013;expressing cells demonstrates an ARF&#x2013;GTPase-activating protein domain&#x2013;mediated inhibitory role for GIT1 at the sides and rear of migrating cells. This suggests that GIT1 serves complementary roles depending on the spatial cellular context. Though the events controlling adhesion signaling and migration via the &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub> or &#x3B1;<sub>5</sub> integrins differ substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mostafavi-Pour et al., 2003</xref>), our studies do not exclude a role for the ARF&#x2013;GTPase-activating protein domain of GIT1 in regulating protrusion.</p><p>Our results show that S273-paxillin is a highly labile and regulated phosphorylation site. Interestingly, paxillin interacts directly with the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2000</xref>), whose inhibition is observed in certain types of cancer and results in hyperphosphorylation of paxillin serine residues and dissolution of FAK&#x2013;Src&#x2013;paxillin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Young et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Romashko and Young, 2004</xref>). This suggests that S273-paxillin phosphorylation might also be under regulation by phosphatases opening a new facet of adhesion turnover regulation through paxillin dephosphorylation.</p><p>Finally, the small adhesions that we observed have interesting properties that distinguish them from other adhesions. They are small (&lt;0.5 &#x3BC;m), turnover rapidly (&lt;1 min), contain GIT1 (as well as other components, such as FAK, vinculin, and zyxin), and reside in a region &#x223C;1 &#x3BC;m behind the leading edge, which also contains phospho-PAK and PIX. They are present in the protrusive regions of normal cells and also highly motile tumor cells. Interestingly, rapidly locomoting cell types such as keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Jacobson, 1997</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yuruker and Niggli, 1992</xref>), and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heiple et al., 1990</xref>) do not show highly organized adhesions. In contrast, most other adhesions are large, elongated, and centrally located; turnover with slower rates (several minutes); and do not have prominent concentrations of GIT1. Slower moving cells, e.g., fibroblasts, form these larger adhesions, whose presence corresponds with a decrease in the migration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Couchman and Rees, 1979</xref>). Therefore, we propose that these small, dynamic adhesions drive the migration of highly motile cells and therefore deserve intense study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>CHO-K1 cells were cultured in low-glucose DME supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin and transfected with 0.25&#x2013;1 &#x3BC;g DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). <italic>Pxl</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> MEFs and Rat2 fibroblasts were cultured in high-glucose DME supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin.

The B71 zyxin (M.C. Beckerle, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT), phospho-PAK (J. Chernoff), and &#xDF;PIX antibodies (B. Xiao, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) were gifts. The GIT1 polyclonal antibody was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manabe et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>A polyclonal phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody was generated by Biosource International against a chemically synthesized peptide Ac-DELMA[pS]LSDFK-amide that is phosphorylated at S273-paxillin. The antibody was purified from rabbit serum by sequential epitope-specific chromatography, followed by negative preadsorption using a nonphospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin peptide to remove antibody reactive to nonphosphorylated paxillin. The final product was generated by affinity chromatography using the phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin mimetic peptide.</p><p>The following secondary antibodies were used: HRP anti&#x2013;mouse IgG and anti&#x2013;rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare), Rhodamine anti&#x2013;mouse and anti&#x2013;rabbit IgG (MP Biomedicals), Alexa Fluor 555 anti&#x2013;mouse antibody and anti&#x2013;rabbit antibody (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro transcription&#x2013;translation coupled kinase assay</title><p>In vitro transcription&#x2013;translation was performed using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. 0.5 &#x3BC;g FLAG-paxillin and 0.75 &#x3BC;g of either CA- or KD-myc-PAK1 in T7-containing plasmids were transcribed and translated for 90 min at 30&#xB0;C. After 90 min, kinase buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 &#x3BC;M ATP was used. The reaction was then allowed to continue for another 30 min at 30&#xB0;C. For binding experiments, untagged WT-paxillin and FLAG-GIT1 were synthesized using the TnT system and incubated for 30 min with either CA- or KD-myc-PAK1 in kinase buffer. Phosphopeptide competition was performed by preincubating in vitro&#x2013;synthesized mixtures of untagged WT-paxillin, FLAG-GIT1, and CA-myc-PAK1 with 500 molar excess of the phospho&#x2013; or nonphospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin peptide for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE; transferred to Immobilon membranes; and probed with the phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin, anti-FLAG, anti-myc, or anti-paxillin antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting</title><p>Cells were grown to 80&#x2013;90% confluency, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation (12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min). Equivalent amounts of the lysates were precleared with 30 &#x3BC;l mouse IgG agarose for 1.5 h at 4&#xB0;C, followed by incubation with 2 &#x3BC;g of the anti-GFP polyclonal antibody for 1.5 h at 4&#xB0;C. Complexes were incubated with protein A&#x2013;agarose for 1 h and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% slabs, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by Western blot analysis. Protein binding levels were compared by densitometry of scanned Western blots using ImageJ software (NIH). Background-corrected densities were measured and normalized to GFP-paxillin densities run on the same gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Rac activity assay</title><p>The GST-PBD fusion protein was purified with glutathione&#x2013;Sepharose beads, and assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ren et al., 1999</xref>). CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-WT-Rac and GFP vector, WT-paxillin-GFP, S273A- paxillin-GFP, or S273D-paxillin-GFP. A positive control with CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with FLAG-V12-Rac and WT-paxillin-GFP was included. Lysates were collected 24 h after transfection and processed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ren et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and image processing</title><p>For live cell imaging, CHO-K1 and Rat2 cells were plated on 1&#x2013;2 &#x3BC;g/ml fibronectin&#x2013;coated glass-bottomed dishes in CCM1 for 1 h and maintained at 37&#xB0;C and pH 7.4. For phase analyses, time-lapse images were captured at 10&#xD7; (NA 0.50; Nikon) with a charge-coupled device camera (Orca II; Hamamatsu) attached to an inverted microscope (TE-300; Nikon). To quantify adhesion turnover, fluorescence images were captured at 60&#xD7; (NA 1.40; Nikon). Image acquisition was controlled using ISee (Inovision) or Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) interfaced to a Ludl modular automation controller (Ludl Electronic Products). For EGFP and rhodamine/alexa, an endow GFP filter cube (excitation HQ470/40 and emission HQ525/50; Q495LP dichroic mirror [Chroma Technology]) and a rhodamine/TRITC cube (excitation BP520-550 and barrier filter BA580IF; DM565 dichroic mirror, [Chroma Technology]) were used, respectively. Exposure times ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 s, and time intervals ranged from 3&#x2013;60 s.</p><p>DIC images for kymograph analyses were obtained on an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus) at 40&#xD7; (NA 0.60; Olympus). Confocal images were collected on a 300 scanhead (Fluoview 300; Olympus) on the inverted microscope fitted with a 60&#xD7; PlanApo oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40; Olympus). GFP and RFP were excited using the 488-nm laser line of an Ar ion laser and the 543-nm laser line of a He-Ne laser (Melles Griot), respectively. A Q500LP dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology) was used for GFP-labeled cells. For dual-color GFP-RFP imaging, a green-red cube (488/543/633) with a DM570 dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology) was used. Fluorescence and DIC images were acquired using Fluoview software (Olympus).</p><p>For acquiring TIRF images, the IX70 inverted microscope equipped with an objective-based TIRF system (Olympus) was used. The excitation laser lines used were as described for confocal microscopy. A dichroic mirror (HQ485/30) was used for GFP-labeled cells. For dual GFP-RFP and CFP-YFP imaging, a dual emission filter (z488/543) and a dual dichroic mirror (emitter, z457/514; beamsplitter, z457/514) were used, respectively. In addition, clean-up filters were used for GFP (Z488/10), CFP (Z458/10), and YFP (514/10). Chroma Technology supplied all mirrors and filters. Images were acquired with a charge-coupled device camera (Retiga Exi; Qimaging) and analyzed using Metamorph software.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed 35-mm dishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palecek et al., 1996</xref>) in CCM1 medium and fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 15 min. 0.15 M glycine was added for 10 min to stop the fixation followed by permeabilization with 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. For immunostaining phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin, PIX, and phosphoactive PAK, the cells were fixed for 3&#x2013;5 min with 3% formaldehyde, followed by chilled methanol for 15 min. After each step, the cells were washed three times with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 2% BSA. Slips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories). For TIRF observation, coverslips were mounted using Slowfade antifade kit (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell migration and protrusion assays</title><p>Cell migration data was generated from time-lapse phase micrographs, and the XY-centroids were determined using Scion Image (NIH). Mean migration rate for each cell was determined by dividing the mean net displacement of the cell centroid divided by the time interval (5 min). Wind Rose plots were generated by transposing individual cell tracks to a common origin.</p><p>Protrusion parameters were quantified using kymography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hinz et al., 1999</xref>). For CHO-K1 and Rat2 cells, images were captured at 30-s intervals for 60- and at 5-min intervals for 5 h, respectively. Kymographs were generated using ImageJ or Metamorph software along 1-pixel-wide regions oriented along the protrusion direction and perpendicular to the lamellipodial edge. Straight lines were drawn from the beginning to the end of single protrusion events in the kymographs; retraction events were ignored. Protrusion rates and protrusion stability were calculated from the slopes and x axis projection distance of these lines, respectively. A minimum of eight cells per treatment and at least three protrusions per cell from three independent experiments were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of adhesion dynamics</title><p>ImageJ or Metamorph software were used to measure the background-corrected fluorescent intensity of individual adhesions over time from cells expressing fluorescently tagged paxillin or vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Paxillin and vinculin incorporation into and departure from adhesions were linear on semilogarithmic plots of the background-corrected fluorescent intensity as a function of time. The <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for formation and disassembly was determined from the slopes of these graphs. For each <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> determination, measurements were obtained for 15&#x2212;20 individual adhesions on four to six cells from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that phospho&#x2013;S273-paxillin antibody is specific and phospho&#x2013; S273-paxillin levels are up-regulated during cell spreading.
