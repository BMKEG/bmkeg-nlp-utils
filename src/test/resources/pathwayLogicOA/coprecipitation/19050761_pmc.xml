          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling is an obligate requirement for normal development and pathological angiogenesis such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. Although autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1173 (Y1173) of VEGFR-2 is considered a focal point for its angiogenic signal relay, however, the mechanism of phosphorylation of Y1173, signaling proteins that are recruited to this residue and their role in angiogenesis is not fully understood.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>In this study we demonstrate that c-Src kinase directly through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and indirectly via c-Cbl binds to phospho-Y1057 of VEGFR-2. Activation of c-Src kinase by a positive feedback mechanism phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at multi-docking site, Y1173. c-Src also catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 and acts as an adaptor to bridge IQGAP1 to VEGFR-2. In turn, IQGAP1 activates b-Raf and mediates proliferation of endothelial cells. Silencing expression of IQGAP1 and b-Raf revealed that their activity is essential for VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis in an <italic>in vivo</italic> angiogenesis model of chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Angiogenesis contributes to the pathology of numerous human diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration. Determining molecular mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and identification of molecules that are relaying its angiogenic signaling may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-associated diseases. Our study shows that recruitment and activation of c-Src by VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in relaying angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2; it phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at Y1173, facilitates association and activation of IQGAP1 and other signaling proteins to VEGFR-2. IQGAP1-dependent signaling, in part, is critically required for endothelial cell proliferation, a key step in angiogenesis. Thus, Y1057 of VEGFR-2 serves to regulate VEGFR-2 function in a combinatorial manner by supporting both diversity of recruitment of angiogenic signaling proteins to VEGFR-2, and its ability to promote angiogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 also called FLK-1/KDR) plays a pivotal role in mediating growth of blood vessels, angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Carmeliet1">[1]</xref>. VEGF stimulation of VEGFR-2 provokes pleiotropic responses in endothelial cells including endothelial cell growth, survival, differentiation, migration, and tube formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Olsson1">[2]</xref>. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1173 (Y1173) of VEGFR-2 is a focal point for activation of angiogenic signal relay of VEGFR-2, as it has emerged as a multi-functional docking site involved in the recruitment of multiple signaling proteins including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85/PI3-K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Dayanir1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Tzima1">[4]</xref>, phospholipase C&#x3B3;1 (PLC&#x3B3;1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Takahashi1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Meyer1">[6]</xref>, Shb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Holmqvist1">[7]</xref>, and the Shc-related adaptor protein, Sck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Igarashi1">[8]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Ratcliffe1">[10]</xref> and the transmission of a range of biological signals to coordinate endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. The critical and direct role of Y1173 in enabling VEGFR-2 to promote angiogenesis was recently revealed by a gene targeting study where mice homozygous for the mutant <italic>VEGFR-2</italic><sup>Y1173F</sup> knock-in allele died between E8.5 and E9.5 without any organized blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Sakurai1">[11]</xref> similar to the VEGFR-2 null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Shalaby1">[12]</xref>. More recent studies indicate that in addition to Y1173, the kinase domain tyrosine, Y1057 also takes part in VEGFR-2 function and is involved in VEGFR-2-mediated cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Zeng1">[13]</xref>. Y1057 along with Y1173 also is engaged in the recruitment and activation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase, c-Cbl. Phospho-Y1057 contributes to the recruitment of c-Cbl to VEGFR-2 by directly associating with c-Cbl, while phospho-Y1173 indirectly via PLC&#x3B3;1 participates in its recruitment to VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref>, resulting in the ubiquitination of PLC&#x3B3;1 and inhibition of angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The recent study indicates that IQGAP1 associates with VEGFR-2 and its activity is required for proliferation of endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-YamaokaTojo1">[26]</xref>. It remains, however, unclear how IQGAP1 interacts with VEGFR-2 since it lacks phospho-tyrosine binding domains such as SH2 and PTB and how its activity is regulated by VEGFR-2. IQGAP1 contains multiple protein-interaction domains including calponin homology domain (CHD), poly-proline-binding domain (WW), calmodulin-binding domain (IQ) and rasGTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) and tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Briggs1">[33]</xref> and is involved in multiple cellular functions including calcium/calmodulin signaling, MAPK signaling and regulation of cytoskeletal structure, cell adhesion and cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Ren1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Roy1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Briggs1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we uncovered a surprising correlation between phosphorylation of Y1057 and Y1173 and that phosphorylation of Y1057 plays a multitasking role in mediating VEGFR-2-directed angiogenic signaling events in endothelial cells. Phospho-Y1057 recruits c-Src kinase to VEGFR-2, and in part catalyzes phosphorylation of Y1173 via Src kinases. c-Src also bridges IQGAP1 to VEGFR-2 and directly phosphorylates IQGAP1 and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, a key step in angiogenesis.</p>

        <title>Identification of tyrosine 1057 of VEGFR-2 as a binding site for Src kinases</title>
        <p>Although stimulation of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells is known to promote activation of Src kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Meyer2">[15]</xref> and Src activation is linked to endothelial cell permeability, survival and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Eliceiri1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Alavi1">[17]</xref>, the nature of its association with VEGFR-2, in particular, the putative phospho-tyrosine residue on VEGFR-2 involved in its recruitment is not. Our survey of several primary endothelial cells including, HUVEC, HMVE and BAEC cells showed that c-Src is ubiquitously tyrosine phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and associates with VEGFR-2 in a ligand-dependent manner in these primary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Cell lysates obtained from HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-293) cells which do not express VEGFR-2 was negative for VEGFR-2 and was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The cytoplasmic region of VEGFR-2 contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Rahimi1">[18]</xref>, albeit none of these tyrosine autophosphorylation sites shows obvious sequence similarities to the preferred Src SH2 recognition motif, pYEEI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Marengere1">[19]</xref>. To analyze association of c-Src with VEGFR-2 we utilized the previously characterized VEGFR-2 chimera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Rahimi2">[20]</xref> herein called CKR which is created by replacing the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 with that of human Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and expressed in PAE (porcine aortic endothelial) cells as an experimental system. In our previous studies we have extensively characterized CKR with VEGFR-2 in a comparative manner. CKR in term of its ability undergo down-regulation, activation, recruitment of signaling proteins and to stimulate cellular responses is identical to VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Dayanir1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Rahimi2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh2">[21]</xref> and data presented in this manuscript. We used this strategy to avoid cross-talk between VEGFR-2 and other VEGF receptors, in particular, VEGFR-1. Our initial observation demonstrated that mutation of tyrosines 799, 820, 925 to phenylalanine (F) and deletion of C-terminus of VEGFR-2 coupled with mutation of tyrosines 1173 and 1212 has no effect on the ability of VEGFR-2 to associate with the SH2 domain of c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, mutation of Y1052 to glutamic acid (E) and particularly Y1057, located in the kinase domain, severely reduced the binding of VEGFR-2 with SH2 domain of c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). GST alone does not associate with CKR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003848.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with its reduced binding capability to E1052, the result showed that E1052 only partially reduces the ability of VEGFR-2 to phosphorylate c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, the potential of mutant Y1057 (E1057/CKR) to stimulate Src tyrosine phosphorylation was severely compromised and was near to undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Since both Y1052 and Y1057 are located in the kinase domain we replaced these residues to glutamic acid (E) rather than phenylalanine (F). This type of mutations has been suggested to be useful for characterization of sensitive tyrosine sites on the RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases) when their mutation to phenylalanine interferes with receptor activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Meyer2">[15]</xref>. However, unlike these RTKs, single mutation of Y1052 and Y1057 either to E or F did not interfere with activation of VEGFR-2 in the context of CKR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003848.s002">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003848.s003">S2</xref>). Furthermore, to make sure that our observation in CKR also is true in the context of non-chimeric VEGFR-2, we mutated Y1057 to F in the full length VEGFR-2, expressed in PAE cells and similarly analyzed for its ability to bind SH2 domain of c-Src. The result showed that VEGFR-2 associates with SH2-Src in VEGF-dependent manner and mutation of Y1057 inhibited association of VEGFR-2 with c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). Altogether, the data show that Y1057 of VEGFR-2 is a major c-Src binding site on VEGFR-2 and its presence is critically required for VEGFR-2 to activate c-Src.</p>

            <p>HUVEC, HMVE and BAE cells were stimulated with VEGF-A (100 &#x3B7;g/ml) for indicated times. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were immunoblotted with an anti-phospho-Src (pY416) antibody (A) or an anti-Src antibody (B). HUVEC, HMVE and HEK-293 cells were either unstimulated (&#x2212;) or stimulated with VEGF (+) for 10 minutes, lysed, immunoprecipitated with c-Src antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (C). Whole cell lysates (WCL) from the same group was immunoblotted with an anti-VEGFR-2 as a control (D). PAE cells expressing wild type chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR) and tyrosine mutant CKRs, F799/CKR, F820/CKR, F925/CKR and carboxyl terminus deleted CKR coupled with mutation of Y1173 and Y1212 denoted as &#x394;CKR/F1173/F1212 was stimulated with CSF-1 for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed, and whole cell lysates were incubated with purified GST-SH2-Src protein. The GST-SH2-Src bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (E). Whole cell lysates from the same groups was blotted with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (F). PAE cells expressing CKR, E1052/CKR, and E1057/CKR were either unstimulated or stimulated with CSF-1 for 10 minutes and cells were lysed and cell lysates was subjected to GST-SH2-Src pull-down assay (G). An immunoblot of whole cell lysates also were probed with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (F,H), an anti-phospho-Src (pY416) antibody (I) or an anti-Src antibody (J). PAE cells expressing VEGFR-2 or F1057/VEGFR-2 were prepared and subjected to pull-down analysis as panel E (K) or whole cell lysates was blotted with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (L). The results shown in A&#x2013;L are representative of three separate experiments.</p>

        <title>c-Cbl associates with c-Src and participates in the interaction of c-Src with VEGFR-2</title>
        <p>A recent study indicates that tyrosine 1057 of VEGFR-2 also serves as a binding site for c-Cbl by directly interacting with its tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref>, raising an interesting possibility as to whether c-Cbl and c-Src competitively bind to Y1057 or c-Cbl acts to bridge c-Src to VEGFR-2 since c-Cbl is known to interact with c-Src via its SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Sanjay1">[22]</xref>. To test these two distinct possibilities, we used PAE cells co-expressing CKR either with wild type c-Cbl or Cbl-N, where the TKB domain is deleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref> and analyzed the ability of GST-SH2 domain of c-Src to interact with VEGFR-2. Over-expression of wild type c-Cbl enhanced association of SH2 domain of c-Src with VEGFR-2, where disabling the binding of c-Cbl with VEGFR-2 had no effect on the binding of SH2-Src to VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantification of the blots (three independent experiments) showed that indeed interaction of VEGFR-2 with GST-SH2-Src is more than doubled when c-Cbl is over-expressed, where as the deletion of TKB domain almost entirely is inhibited this effect of c-Cbl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Over-expression of either c-Cbl or c-Cbl-N had no effect on the protein levels of CKR or on its tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>). Expression of c-Cbl and c-Cbl-N also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Since up-regulation of c-Cbl by over-expression enhanced association of c-Src with VEGFR-2, we further tested whether silencing expression of c-Cbl by siRNA would reduce interaction of SH2-Src with VEGFR-2. As shown, silencing the expression of c-Cbl in PAE cells reduced the binding of GST-SH2 Src with VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Quantification of the blots (three independent experiments) is also shown which further support the hypothesis that endogenous c-Cbl plays a role in bridging c-Src to VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). The silencing effect of c-Cbl-siRNA on the c-Cbl protein level also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). It showed be noted that c-Cbl is highly expressed in these cells and siRNA only partially reduced its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Altogether, the data show that c-Cbl, in part, facilitates association of Src with VEGFR-2.

The result shows that SH2 domain of Src also directly interacts with phosphorylated Y1057 in a c-Cbl independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2J</xref>), suggesting that the interaction of c-Src with Y1057 of VEGFR-2 is established by a direct binding involving its SH2 domain and an indirect interaction involving c-Cbl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g002">Figure 2K</xref> summarizes our observation regarding interaction of c-Src with VEGFR-2 and role of c-Cbl in this process.</p>

Hence we investigated a possible crosstalk between the kinase domain tyrosines (i.e., Y1052 and Y1057) and Y1173 and the potential role of Src kinases in this crosstalk. For this aim, we tested phosphorylation of Y1173 in the background of E1052/CKR and E1057/CKR expressed in PAE cells. The result showed that mutation of 1057 markedly reduced ligand-dependent phosphorylation of Y1173 as detected by an anti-phospho-Y1173 specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Mutation of Y1052 only slightly reduced phosphorylation of Y1173, suggesting that Y1057 but not Y1052, is specifically involved in modulation of phosphorylation of Y1173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, mutation of either Y1052 or Y1057 had no major effect on the phosphorylation Y1212 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Quantification of phosphorylation of Y1173 and Y1212 obtained from three separate independent experiments also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Since Src kinase binds to Y1057 of VEGFR-2, we tested potential role of Src in the phosphorylation of Y1173. Our analysis showed that co-expression of v-Src with non-chimeric wild-type VEGFR-2 in a transient transfection of HEK-293 cells also increases phosphorylation of Y1173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), where phosphorylation of Y1052, Y1057 and Y1212 were not effected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g003">Figure 3F&#x2013;H</xref>).

The data showed that stimulation of SYF cells ectopically expressing chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR) with ligand increases phosphorylation of Y1052.

Only a long exposure of the film detected a weak phosphorylation of Y1173 (data not shown), suggesting that in addition to Src kinases, VEGFR-2 itself also catalyzes phosphorylation of Y1173 of VEGFR-2. Since in the recent years various Src inhibitors were used for therapeutic purposes in cancer and anti-angiogenesis treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Summy1">[25]</xref>, we tested the effect of Src-specific inhibitor, SU6656 to inhibit phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 at Y1173.

To test the role of c-Src in endothelial cell proliferation further we knocked down c-Src expression in HUVE and HMVE cells by siRNA strategy and tested their VEGF-dependent proliferation.

        <title>Identification of IQGAP1 as a novel Src kinase substrate</title>
        <p>IQGAP1 is a scaffold protein and participates in signaling cascades mediated by a diverse group of cell surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Briggs1">[33]</xref>, including VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-YamaokaTojo1">[26]</xref>.

Our initial observation showed that IQGAP1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in PAE cells by VEGFR-2 and mutation of Y1057 reduces the ability of VEGFR-2 to stimulate its tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). IQGAP1 also is tyrosine phosphorylated by other RTKs including, ErbB1/EGFR-1 and PDGFR&#x3B2; ectopically expressed in PAE cells (our unpublished data), suggesting that IQGAP1 serves as a common substrate for RTKs. In addition, our data show that over-expression of c-Src in PAE cells highly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1.

        <p>To further establish role of c-Src in phosphorylation of IQGAP1 we show that in SYF knockout cells where Src family kinases (Yes, Fyn and Src) are absent, IQGAP1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of VEGFR-2, where re-introduction of c-Src rescued phosphorylation of IQGAP1 by VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Our further studies showed that in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay recombinant c-Src protein phosphorylates GST-fusion IQGAP1 (data not shown). Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that IQGAP1 directly associates with c-Src and undergoes c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Hence to further establish as to whether c-Src interacts with IQGAP1 we tested the ability of SH2 and SH3 domains of c-Src to associate with IQGAP1 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay. The result showed that SH2 domain of c-Src interacts with IQGAP1 independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation since SH2 domain of c-Src forms a complex with IQGAP1 prior to stimulation of cells with ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Additional analysis using PAE cells null for chimeric VEGFR-2 revealed that indeed association of SH2 domain of Src with IQGAP1 is independent of VEGFR-2 (data not shown). In contrast to the SH2 domain, the SH3 domain of c-Src failed to interact with IQGAP1 with or without stimulation of VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5I</xref>).

        <title>IQGAP1 signaling pathway is required for VEGF-induced angiogenesis</title>
        <p>To establish the biological importance of IQGAP1 in VEGFR-2 signaling, we initially examined its role in proliferation of endothelial cells. To this end, we employed siRNA-mediated knockdown strategy and analyzed proliferation of endothelial cells in response to VEGF stimulation. IQGAP1 siRNA significantly reduced expression of IQGAP1 in HMVE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5L</xref>). We further analyzed these cells for their ability to undergo proliferation in response to VEGF. Silencing the expression of IQGAP1 in primary endothelial cells, but not control siRNA, significantly inhibited VEGF-dependent cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5M</xref>), suggesting that VEGFR-2/c-Src orchestrated tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 serves an important role in endothelial cell proliferation. Our recent study indicates that IQGAP1 is capable of modulating activity of b-Raf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Ren1">[27]</xref>, to test whether IQGAP1 activity is also required for b-Raf phosphorylation in endothelial cells in response to VEGFR-2 activation we tested phosphorylation of b-Raf where expression of IQGAP1 is knocked down by siRNA. The data show that stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF promotes phosphorylation of b-Raf at Ser 455 and silencing expression of IQGAP1 notably reduced its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5N</xref>). Quantification of phosphorylation of Ser 455 of b-Raf based on the three independent experiments also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5Q</xref>). The reduced phosphorylation of b-Raf in IQGAP1 siRNA treated cells was not due to the differential amount of protein since relatively equal amount of b-Raf protein is present in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5O</xref>). The expression of IQGAP1 in cells treated with control siRNA or IQGAP1 siRNA also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5P</xref>). In short, the data indicate that VEGFR-2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, in part, is established by Src, IQGAP1and b-Raf axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g005">Figure 5R</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further address the physiological importance of c-Src, IQGAP1and b-Raf in angiogenesis in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, we used chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assay where their expression were knocked down by siRNA strategy. The result showed that targeting IQGAP1, c-Src and b-Raf individually by siRNA suppresses the ability of VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), where control siRNA had no negative effect on angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, quantification of CAM assay showed that VEGF treatment of CAM induced robust angiogenic response where IQGAP1-siRNA, c-Src-siRNA and b-Raf-siRNA each decreased VEGF-induced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). As noted the siRNA-mediated inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis was near to baseline angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) underscoring the importance of this pathway for VEGF-induced angiogenesis. The ability of these specific siRNAs to knockdown expression of c-Src, IQGAP1 and b-Raf also are analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6C, 6E, 6G</xref>). The same membranes were re-probed for PLC&#x3B3;1 as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003848-g006">Figure 6D, 6F, 6H</xref>).

Phosphorylation of Y1057 plays a combinatorial role in VEGFR-2 signaling; it recruits c-Src kinase to VEGFR-2, regulates phosphorylation of multi-docking Y1173 site, mediates VEGFR-2-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis through IQGAP1 and b-Raf. One of the most interesting aspects of this study is the discovery of an unexpected role of Src family kinases in the phosphorylation of Y1173 of VEGFR-2. Y1173 of VEGFR-2 is considered to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> mediator of angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2 <italic>in vivo</italic> since its mutation abrogates its ability to stimulate angiogenesis during mouse embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Meyer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Sakurai1">[11]</xref> and Y1173 functions as a multi-docking residue on VEGFR-2 that recruits p85/PI3kinase, PLC&#x3B3;1, Shb, and Sck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Dayanir1">[3]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Holmqvist1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Ratcliffe1">[10]</xref>. Thus, phosphorylation of Y1173 by Src kinases represents one pathway by which the intensity and extent of Y1173-dependent signaling of VEGFR-2 is controlled. Conversely, inhibition of Src kinases could skew the binding of these signaling proteins to VEGFR-2 and their subsequent activation by VEGFR-2.</p>
      <p>A recent study indicates that c-Cbl directly interacts with Y1057 of VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Singh1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, not only does c-Src bind directly to Y1057, but c-Cbl provides an additional mechanism for c-Src to interact with VEGFR-2 by serving as an &#x201C;adaptor&#x201D; which in turn may modulate its activation by VEGFR-2. Activation of c-Src is linked to vascular permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Eliceiri1">[16]</xref>, endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Eliceiri1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Alavi1">[17]</xref>. Our findings show that although c-Src activity is dispensable for VEGFR-2-dependent tube formation of endothelial cells, its activity is highly critical for VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in CAM model of angiogenesis. The mechanism by which c-Src contributes to VEGFR-2-dependent cell proliferation is linked, in part to its ability to phosphorylate Y1173, which is known to regulate VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Takahashi1">[5]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Holmqvist1">[7]</xref>. c-Src also associates with IQGAP1 in endothelial cells and catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 which acts as a downstream target of VEGFR-2 and c-Src to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. A recent work has demonstrated that c-Src regulates activation of Raf-1 (also known as c-Raf) in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Alavi1">[17]</xref>. c-Src also associates directly with another Raf family protein, b-Raf, leading to activation of MAPK pathway in a Ras-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Ren1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Briggs1">[33]</xref>. Our demonstration that IQGAP1 is activated by VEGFR-2 further supports earlier studies that shows VEGFR-2 activates MAPK pathway in Ras-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003848-Roy1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in this study we have identified and defined a molecular switch by which VEGFR-2 regulates endothelial cell proliferation and stimulates angiogenesis by identifying Y1057 of VEGFR-2 that undergoes phosphorylation and orchestrates recruitment and activation of c-Src and modulates endothelial cell proliferation via IQGAP1-dependent signaling pathway.</p>
