      <title>Introductory paragraph</title>
      <p id="P2">DNA-double strand break (DSB) repair involves complex interactions between chromatin and repair proteins, including the Tip60 tumor suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Tip60 is an acetyltransferase which acetylates both histones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> and the ATM kinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Inactivation of Tip60 leads to defective DNA repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and increased cancer risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. However, how DNA damage activates Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity is not known. Here, we show that direct interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) at DSBs activates Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. Depletion of intracellular H3K9me3 blocks activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity, resulting in defective ATM activation and widespread defects in DSB repair. In addition, the ability of Tip60 to access H3K9me3 is dependent on the DNA damage induced displacement of HP1&#x3B2; from H3K9me3. Finally, we demonstrate that the mre11-rad50-nbs1 complex targets Tip60 to H3K9me3, and is required to activate Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. These results reveal a new function for H3K9me3 in co-ordinating activation of Tip60-dependent DNA repair pathways, and imply that aberrant patterns of histone methylation may contribute to cancer by altering the efficiency of DSB repair.</p>
      <p id="P3">The Tip60 acetyltransferase is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is altered in both breast and prostate tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. Tip60 acetylates key proteins involved in the DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and plays a critical role in the detection and repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Currently, the mechanism by which Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity is increased by DNA damage is not known. Here, we examined if interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> and histones adjacent to DSBs regulate Tip60 acetyltransferase activity. Chromodomains are specialized binding modules containing conserved hydrophobic amino-acids which interact with methyl groups on methylated lysine residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. For example, the chromodomain of HP1&#x3B1; interacts with histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. Sequence alignment of the chromodomains of Tip60 and HP1&#x3B1; demonstrates that Tip60 contains the conserved aromatic amino-acids required for HP1&#x3B1; binding to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">figure S1a</xref>), implying that Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain functions as a methyl-lysine binding domain. To examine this possibility, point mutations were introduced into Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain, and the ability of the DNA-damaging agent bleomycin to activate Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity examined. The acetyltransferase activity of immunopurified Tip60 was quantitated by measuring the ability of Tip60 to acetylate a peptide derived from histone H4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">figure S1b</xref>), one of Tip60&#x2019;s <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. DNA damage increases the acetyltransferase activity of both endogenous and transfected Tip60 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">figure S1c and S1d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, but does not alter the overall level of Tip60 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">figure S2b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. The Tip60 proteins with mutations in the chromodomain were stably expressed in HeLaS3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">figure S2a</xref>), and their intrinsic acetyltransferase activity measured. Mutation of phenylalanine-43 (Tip60<sup>F43A</sup>) or tyrosine-47 (Tip60<sup>Y47A</sup>) in Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain abolished activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity, whereas mutations in tryptophan-26 (Tip60<sup>W26A</sup>) or phenylalanine-50 (Tip60<sup>F50A</sup>) had little or no impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>). Activation of Tip60 by DSBs leads to the Tip60-dependent acetylation and activation of the ATM kinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Mutations in the chromodomain which abolished activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity (Tip60<sup>F43A</sup> and Tip60<sup>Y47A</sup>) also blocked the Tip60-dependent acetylation and autophosphorylation of the ATM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). A more detailed analysis of cells expressing the Tip60<sup>Y47A</sup> mutant (referred to as Tip60<sup>CD</sup>) revealed a profound defect in both ATM activation and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of chk2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">figure S2b</xref>), indicating that Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain is essential for activation of the ATM signaling pathway.</p>
      <p id="P4">Chromodomains function as methyl-lysine binding proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, implying that Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain may be essential to recruit and retain Tip60 at DSB. However, the Tip60<sup>CD</sup> mutant was efficiently recruited to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>), indicating that the chromodomain is not required to target Tip60 to DSBs. This implies that an alternative mechanism must exist to recruit Tip60 to sites of DNA damage. Previously, we demonstrated that Tip60 and ATM exist as a unique complex in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, and that, in the absence of ATM, Tip60 recruitment to DSBs is severely compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. In addition to Tip60, the efficient recruitment of ATM to DSBs and activation of ATM&#x2019;s kinase requires the mre11-rad50-nbs1 (MRN) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. This suggests that Tip60 is recruited to MRN at DSBs as part of an ATM-Tip60 complex. To test this possibility, we first demonstrated that the interaction between ATM and Tip60 was not altered by mutations of Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">figure S2a</xref>). Next, we examined the role of the MRN complex in Tip60 activation using cells in which the rad50 component of MRN was reduced by shRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2b</xref>). Cells in which rad50 was depleted failed to recruit Tip60 to DSBs within 15 minutes of exposure to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1d and 1e</xref>), although there was a slow accumulation of Tip60 at DSBs at later times. Formation of &#x3B3;H2AX foci was unaffected by either rad50 depletion or mutational inactivation of Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">figure S3a</xref>). However, activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2a</xref>) and the Tip60-dependent acetylation and activation of the ATM kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2b</xref>) were reduced in cells lacking functional MRN complex. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that cells with compromised MRN function exhibit reduced or attenuated activation of the ATM kinase in response to DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. These results demonstrate that both Tip60 and the MRN complex make critical contributions to the activation of ATM at endogenous DSBs. Cells in which the chromodomain of Tip60 is mutated should therefore exhibit a defective DNA damage response. Consistent with this, cells expressing the Tip60<sup>CD</sup> mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref>), and contained significantly higher levels of chromosome aberrations after exposure to ionizing radiation (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S3b</xref>). These results indicate a model in which the previously characterized ATM-Tip60 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> is recruited to the MRN complex as an inactive ATM-Tip60 complex. Activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase (through a mechanism involving the chromodomain) then leads to acetylation of ATM and activation of ATM&#x2019;s kinase.</p>
      <p id="P5">Next, we determined how Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain contributes to the regulation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. Histone H3 is methylated <italic>in vivo</italic> on lysines 4, 9, 27, 36 and 79, making H3 a potential binding partner for Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. Calf thymus H3 (which is post-translationally modified) and recombinant H3 which was methylated <italic>in vitro</italic> activated the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">figure S4a and S4b</xref>), but not the Tip60<sup>CD</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">figure S4c</xref>). This implies that methylated histone H3 activates Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity through interaction with Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain. To identify the methylation sites on H3, peptides corresponding to the major histone H3 methylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 1</xref>) were examined for their ability to stimulate Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. H3 peptides di- or tri-methylated at lysines 4, 27 and 79 did not stimulate Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a</xref>), whereas H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 peptides activated Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. H3K9me2 had a small stimulatory effect on Tip60 acetyltransferase activity. Tip60 showed a concentration dependent increase in acetyltransferase activity when incubated with increasing concentrations of H3K9me3 peptide, but not with H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">figure S5a</xref>). Importantly, peptides containing either H3K9me3 or H3K36me3 did not significantly activate the acetyltransferase activity of the Tip60<sup>CD</sup> chromodomain mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3b</xref>), implying specific interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and H3K9me3 or H3K36me3. To further examine these interactions, nuclear extracts containing Tip60 were incubated with methylated H3 peptides immobilized on affinity resin. Tip60 was specifically bound to H3K9me3 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S5b</xref>), whereas the Tip60<sup>CD</sup> mutant failed to bind to H3K9me3 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S5c</xref>). However, no significant binding of Tip60 to H3K36me3 was seen under standard binding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3b</xref>), although weak binding of H3K36me3 to Tip60 was detected under low stringency binding conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">figure S5d</xref>). This implies that the interaction between Tip60 and H3K36me3 is significantly weaker than the interaction with H3K9me3, implying that H3K9me3 is the primary binding site for Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain. To further confirm this conclusion, the interaction between purified <italic>in vitro</italic> translated (IVT) Tip60 protein and H3K9me3 was examined. IVT Tip60, but not IVT Tip60<sup>CD</sup>, bound specifically to H3K9me3, but not H3K4me3, H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3e</xref>) or to H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">figure S5e</xref>). Further, Tip60 was the only detectable polypeptide associated with the H3K9me3 affinity column, indicating that Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain interacts directly with H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">figure S6a and S6b</xref>). When IVT Tip60 was prebound to immobilized H3K9me3 affinity columns, Tip60 was specifically eluted by H3K9me3 peptide, but not by either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3f</xref>). Finally, the acetyltransferase activity of purified IVT Tip60 (but not IVT Tip60<sup>CD</sup>) was specifically activated by the H3K9me3 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">figure S6c</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> therefore demonstrates that direct interaction between H3K9me3 and Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain specifically activates Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity, implying that the chromodomain of Tip60 functions as an allosteric regulator of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity.</p>
      <p id="P6">Next, we determined if the levels of H3K9me3 were important for Tip60 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. MEFS derived from mice in which the 2 main H3K9 methyltransferases, Suv39h1 and Suv39h2, are deleted were examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Suv39h1/2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice have reduced levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>) and display increased genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4a</xref>), and the Tip60-dependent activation of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>) was significantly impaired in Suv39h1/2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> MEFs immediately following exposure to ionizing radiation. However, weak ATM activation was detected at later time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">figure S7</xref>) in Suv39h1/2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> MEFs. Reduced methylation of H3K9me3 therefore correlates with defective activation of Tip60 and ATM in Suv39h1/2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> MEFs. To further manipulate H3K9 methylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, histone demethylases which specifically demethylate H3K9me3 (Jmjd2D/KDM4D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) or both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 (Jmjd2A/KDM4A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) were expressed in cells in order to reduce the levels of H3K9me3. Demethylation of H3K27me3 (Jmjd3/KDM6B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) was used as a control. The histone demethylases were efficiently expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">figure S8a</xref>), and specifically demethylated H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">figure S8b and S8c</xref>). Demethylation of H3K9, H3K27 or H3K36 did not affect the formation of &#x3B3;H2AX foci, or the recruitment of the MRN complex to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c</xref>). Demethylation of histones does not, therefore, impose structural or other changes in the chromatin which inhibit DNA damage signaling events. In addition, Tip60 was recruited to DSBs in cells in which H3K9me3 levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c</xref>), providing further evidence that interactions between methylated histones and Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain are not required to recruit Tip60 to DSBs. Demethylation of either H3K9me3 (by Jmjd2D/KDM4D) or both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 (by Jmjd2A/KDM4A) inhibited the activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity by bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4d</xref>). Demethylation of H3K27me3 (by Jmjd3/KDM6B) had no effect. Demethylation of H3K9me3 (by either Jmjd2D/KDM4D or Jmjd2A/KDM4A) also blocked the Tip60-dependent activation of the ATM DNA damage response pathway, blocking ATM autophosphorylation, and preventing the subsequent phosphorylation of p53 and chk2 by ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4e</xref>). However, phosphorylation of H2AX, which can be mediated by DNA-PKcs in the absence of ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, was unaffected by demethylation of histone H3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> therefore demonstrates that activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity by DNA damage is inhibited when the levels of H3K9me3 in the cell are reduced. This is consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>, and indicates that interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and H3K9me3 at DSBs mediates activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity.</p>
      <p id="P7">To confirm that Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and H3K9me3 interact <italic>in vivo</italic>, Tip60 immunoprecipitates were examined for the presence of H3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref> demonstrates that bleomycin induced a DNA-damage dependent interaction between Tip60 and histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5a</xref>) and that this co-precipitating histone H3 was trimethylated on lysine 9. This interaction between Tip60 and H3 was significantly reduced in cells expressing the Tip60 chromodomain mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5a</xref>). When H3K9me3 methylation was reduced by expression of the histone demethylases Jmjd2D/KDM4D or Jmjd2A/KDM4A, the DNA damage dependent interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and histone H3 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5b</xref>). Further, isolation of intact Tip60-H3K9me3 complexes could be achieved without disrupting the chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">figure S8e</xref>), suggesting that the Tip60-H3 complexes are either mobile within the nucleoplasm, or are only weakly associated with the chromatin after DNA damage. The results are consistent with a model in which the recruitment of Tip60 to DSBs leads to direct interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and H3K9me3, increasing Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. Cells lacking H3K9me3 should therefore be sensitive to agents which generate DSBs. Indeed, demethylation of H3K9 (by Jmjd2D/KDM4D) but not H3K27 (by Jmjd3/KDM6B) sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5c</xref>). H3K9me3 is therefore essential for activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity and for cells to survive ionizing radiation exposure.</p>
      <p id="P8">Interaction between Tip60 and H3K9me3 may occur either through DNA damage induced H3K9 methylation at DSBs, or through utilization of pre-existing H3K9 methylation sites by Tip60 at DSBs. The overall levels of H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 are unaltered following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">figure S8d</xref>), indicating that interactions with pre-existing H3 methylation sites are involved. The majority of the cellular H3K9me3 is bound by the HP1 family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, potentially making it unavailable for interaction with Tip60. However, following DNA damage, the chromodomain of HP1&#x3B2; is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, and this phosphorylation leads to release of HP1&#x3B2; from H3K9me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. This DNA damage induced release of HP1&#x3B2; from the chromatin may generate domains of H3K9me3 which can interact with Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain. Therefore, we examined if release of HP1&#x3B2; from the chromatin was required for activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity. Chromatin fractionation studies confirmed that HP1&#x3B2; is located on the chromatin prior to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5d</xref>), and that a significant fraction of this HP1&#x3B2; is released to the nucleoplasm following exposure to bleomycin. Prior treatment of cells with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB), a highly specific inhibitor of casein kinase 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, blocked release of HP1&#x3B2; from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5d</xref>), as previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. Inhibition of casein kinase II with TBB also blocked activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase by bleomycin and prevented the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of chk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5e</xref>). To determine if this effect was specific for HP1&#x3B2;, HP1&#x3B2; levels were depleted with siRNA, generating domains of H3K9me3 devoid of HP1&#x3B2; In the absence of HP1&#x3B2; the ability of TBB to block activation of Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity and prevent phosphorylation of chk2 was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">These results indicate that access of Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain to H3K9me3 is controlled through 2 key steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5f</xref>). First, the DNA-damage dependent ejection of HP1&#x3B2; from the chromatin is required to produce domains of H3K9me3 adjacent to the DSB. Second, association of the MRN complex with DSBs is required to efficiently recruit the inactive ATM-Tip60 complex to the DNA damage site. The localization of the ATM-Tip60 complex to the DSB facilitates productive interactions between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and adjacent chromatin domains containing H3K9me3. This interaction increases Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity, leading to the acetylation and activation of the ATM kinase, as well as the potential for Tip60 to directly acetylate other histones on the chromatin. The binding of H3K9me3 to Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain therefore functions as an allosteric regulator of Tip60&#x2019;s catalytic activity, rather than as a binding module for recruiting Tip60 to DSB. In addition to Tip60, interactions between the MRN complex and ATM may also provide critical inputs for generating and maintaining ATM in its active form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. These results therefore provide a mechanistic framework which links together previous observations on the relative contributions of the MRN complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, ATM autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> and Tip60-dependent acetylation of ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> to the activation of the ATM kinase. Further, H3K9me3 is predominantly located in the compacted, heterochromatic regions of the chromatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, where it is associated with HP1. This suggests that Tip60 may be preferentially activated by DSBs generated within heterochromatin, which would be consistent with reports that the repair of DSBs in heterochromatin involves ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. However, because H3K9me3 can be found in non-heterochromatin regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, Tip60 function is unlikely to be entirely restricted to heterochromatic regions during DNA damage responses. These results also have important consequences for human disease. Histone methylation patterns differ between cell lineages and are frequently altered in human tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>. These altered histone methylation signatures may play a key role in the etiology of cancer by regulating the efficiency and extent of DNA repair at specific sites in the chromatin. The tumor suppressor functions of Tip60 are therefore intimately linked to the levels of H3K9me3, and to the methyltransferases and demethylases which regulate this histone modification.</p>

CK2-dependent phosphorylation of HP1&#x3B2; releases HP1&#x3B2; from the chromatin. Subsequent recruitment of the ATM-Tip60 to MRN facilitates interaction between Tip60&#x2019;s chromodomain and free H3K9me3. Tip60&#x2019;s acetyltransferase activity is upregulated, leading to acetylation and activation of ATM&#x2019;s kinase activity. The fully active ATM kinase then phosphorylates key target proteins and regulates ATM-dependent signaling events. Recruitment of CK2 and MRN to the DSB are independent events.</p>
