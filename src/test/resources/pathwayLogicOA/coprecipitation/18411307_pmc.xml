      <abstract>
        <p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) trigger accumulation of the MRE11&#x2013;RAD50&#x2013;Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1 [MRN]) complex, whose retention on the DSB-flanking chromatin facilitates survival. Chromatin retention of MRN requires the MDC1 adaptor protein, but the mechanism behind the MRN&#x2013;MDC1 interaction is unknown. We show that the NBS1 subunit of MRN interacts with the MDC1 N terminus enriched in Ser-Asp-Thr (SDT) repeats. This interaction was constitutive and mediated by binding between the phosphorylated SDT repeats of MDC1 and the phosphate-binding forkhead-associated domain of NBS1. Phosphorylation of the SDT repeats by casein kinase 2 (CK2) was sufficient to trigger MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction in vitro, and MDC1 associated with CK2 activity in cells. Inhibition of CK2 reduced SDT phosphorylation in vivo, and disruption of the SDT-associated phosphoacceptor sites prevented the retention of NBS1 at DSBs. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the SDT repeats in the MDC1 N terminus functions to recruit NBS1 and, thereby, increases the local concentration of MRN at the sites of chromosomal breakage.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a major threat to genomic integrity by promoting mutations, gene deletions, and/or chromosomal translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiloh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kastan and Bartek, 2004</xref>). These adverse effects are counteracted by genome surveillance machinery that is designed to rapidly detect DSBs, delay cell cycle progression, initiate DNA repair, or, in case of excessive damage, activate the cell death program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nyberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukas et al., 2004b</xref>). Because the maintenance of genome integrity requires extreme accuracy and coordination of elaborate, often intertwined molecular pathways, cells evolved numerous means to increase the efficiency of this process. Among others, virtually every eukaryotic cell responds to DSBs by concentrating signaling, repair, and various adaptor proteins in the vicinity of DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukas et al., 2005</xref>). Although the purpose of this phenomenon (cytologically manifested by the formation of nuclear foci enriched in various DSB regulators) is not yet fully understood, several intriguing scenarios have been considered: for instance, DNA damage&#x2013;induced protein accumulation may facilitate the formation of active repair holocomplexes, increase the availability of these enzymes at the sites of genetic lesions, generate a local chromatin microenvironment supportive for repair-associated DNA transactions, and/or amplify the DSB-associated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Essers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stucki and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>). Thus, the local concentration of DSB regulators emerges as a vital tool to increase the fidelity of the genome surveillance machinery.</p><p>Prominent among the cellular factors that accumulate at DSBs is the MRE11&#x2013;RAD50&#x2013;Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1 [MRN]) complex, an essential genome caretaker that regulates crucial steps of the DSB response such as DSB detection, activity of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase (the key upstream component of DSB signaling), cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Amours and Jackson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petrini and Stracker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stracker et al., 2004</xref>), and, as the most recent advancements suggest, induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Difilippantonio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stracker et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the MRN complex participates in the resection of DNA ends, an essential step required for an error-free DSB repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri et al., 2006</xref>). Such diverse involvement in the DSB response is reflected by the nuclear dynamics of MRN. Most notably, recent studies revealed that the distribution of NBS1 (and other MRN components) at the DSB sites is not uniform but splits into distinct subcompartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>). Although a fraction of MRN interacts with single-stranded DNA formed after enzymatic DSB resection (consistent with the essential role of MRN in DSB resection), the bulk of the DSB-associated MRN accumulates within the vast regions of chromatin marked by ATM-phosphorylated histone H2AX (&#x3B3;-H2AX). It is indeed this chromatin-associated fraction of MRN that cytologically manifests as the so-called ionizing radiation (IR)&#x2013;induced foci.</p><p>The function of the chromatin-bound MRN has been subjected to intensive investigation and yielded important insights. Thus, it was found that the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of NBS1 is necessary for its retention at the DSB-flanking chromatin and that its disruption impairs IR-induced foci formation of the entire MRN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerosaletti and Concannon, 2003</xref>). Reconstitution experiments in human cells derived from the NBS patients suggested that the NBS1 N terminus, where the FHA domain resides, is important for survival, optimal ATM activity, and the intra&#x2013;S-phase checkpoint after IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerosaletti and Concannon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horejsi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerosaletti et al., 2006</xref>). However, because these assays were performed on the background of low levels of hypomorphic NBS1 alleles, the exact role of the chromatin-bound MRN remained a matter of debate. An important breakthrough in this discussion has been recently provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Difilippantonio et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2007</xref>), who generated a mouse strain in which the endogenous NBS1 gene was replaced by a mutant with the disrupted FHA domain. Remarkably, although these mice were viable, they displayed defects in the DNA damage&#x2013;induced G2/M- and S-phase checkpoints, an increased incidence of chromosomal aberrations, attenuated ATM activity after low doses of IR, and a decreased radiation survival. Although it is possible that the NBS1 N terminus supports other functions than the chromatin tethering of MRN, these results provide the most compelling evidence so far that the chromatin-bound MRN contributes to reach the threshold of the DNA damage signaling (especially after a low dose of IR), thereby guarding against chromosomal instability.</p><p>Although the requirement of the NBS1-FHA domain for the MRN focus formation has been established, the way this domain communicates with the DSB-flanking chromatin and/or the associated proteins is less clear. An earlier study suggested that the NBS1-FHA domain directly binds to &#x3B3;-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>). However, more recent results showed that the interaction of NBS1 with the DSBs requires MDC1, a large adaptor protein and an important upstream coordinator of the DSB-induced chromatin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). MDC1 contains tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains, which bind with high specificity to phosphorylated Ser139 of &#x3B3;-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stucki et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, MDC1 is among the first proteins to accumulate at the DSB sites, and its productive assembly in this compartment is a prerequisite for retention of most of the known chromatin-binding DSB regulators, including the MRN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stucki and Jackson, 2006</xref>). The key evidence for the causative role of MDC1 for MRN focus formation was provided by several independent studies, which all showed that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of MDC1 by RNA interference in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>) or a complete MDC1 knockout in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lou et al., 2006</xref>) prevented MRN retention at the DSB-flanking chromatin. Importantly, kinetic measurements in living cells extended these results by showing that the MDC1 knockdown abolished MRN retention at DSBs from the earliest stages after DNA damage and that in the absence of MDC1, NBS1 could not concentrate at the DSB-flanking chromatin despite the fact that H2AX was efficiently phosphorylated in these compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>).</p><p>At lest three additional pieces of evidence suggested that the retention of MRN at the DSB-flanking (and &#x3B3;-H2AX decorated) chromatin is not direct but is mediated by interaction with MDC1. First, peptides derived from the phosphorylated &#x3B3;-H2AX C terminus interacted with MRN only in the presence of MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>). Second, MDC1 can be efficiently copurified with MRN from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>). Importantly, this interaction was dependent on the phosphate-binding FHA domain of NBS1, suggesting that the formation of a productive MDC1&#x2013;MRN complex is phosphorylation dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>). Third, real-time imaging of protein assembly in live cells revealed that NBS1 accumulates at the DSB-flanking chromatin with a dynamics that is indistinguishable from that of MDC1 (but significantly faster than other chromatin-binding proteins such as 53BP1 or BRCA1), an observation that further supported the emerging model of the intimate relationship between MDC1 and the MRN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although intriguing, these results left several mechanistic questions unanswered: most notably, it remains unclear whether the phosphosubstrate of the NBS1-FHA domain is indeed MDC1 itself or whether the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction requires yet another, hitherto unrecognized (phospho)intermediate. Furthermore, the identity of the protein kinases and the phosphorylation sites that generate the recognition signal for the NBS1-FHA domain (and thus promote retention of MRN on the DSB-flanking chromatin) have not been determined. In an attempt to resolve these issues, we performed a detailed analysis of the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction in vitro and in cells. We show that the NBS1-FHA domain binds to the N-terminal part of MDC1 enriched in acidic Ser-Asp-Thr (SDT) repeats. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the SDT repeats are constitutively phosphorylated, at least in part, by casein kinase 2 (CK2). These SDT phosphorylations are functionally significant because they trigger productive interaction between MDC1 and NBS1 and determine the retention of MRN at the DSB-modified chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The FHA domain of NBS1 interacts with the N-terminal part of MDC1</title><p>Endogenous MDC1 and NBS1 proteins efficiently interact both before and after DNA damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and contain numerous structural motifs and potential targets for posttranslational modifications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) that might be involved in this interaction. To elucidate the requirements for the MDC1&#x2013;MRN interaction, we first constructed a series of HA-tagged fragments progressively spanning the N-terminal part of MDC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We transiently expressed each of these fragments in a U2OS cell line in which the endogenous MDC1 was down-regulated by stably integrated short hairpin RNA (shRNA; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>) and tested their ability to interact with endogenous NBS1. The MDC1 fragments were constructed so that they were not affected by the shRNA to endogenous MDC1 (see Materials and methods), and the robust down-regulation of MDC1 in this cell line (designated U2OS/shMDC1) allowed us to assess the binding efficiency of each fragment unbiased by higher-order complexes containing the endogenous protein. Under these conditions, a fragment spanning the first 500 amino acids of MDC1 appeared to be necessary and sufficient to bind cellular NBS1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, lane 6), and this binding did not further increase after including the more C-terminal sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, although MDC1 also contains an FHA domain at the very N terminus, this domain (either isolated or in the context of a larger fragment spanning up to the first 200 amino acids of MDC1) appeared to be entirely dispensable for NBS1 interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction between NBS1 and MDC1 is mediated by the FHA domain of NBS1 and the first 500 amino acids of MDC1.</bold> (A) Endogenous MDC1 and NBS1 interact both before and after DNA damage. Lysates from U2OS cells either mock or &#x3B3; irradiated (10 Gy for 1 h) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-MDC1 antibody and analyzed for the presence of NBS1 by immunoblotting. A nonimmune species-matched antibody was used as a control. Expression levels of NBS1 in whole cell extracts (bottom) indicate an equal input in each lane. (B) A schematic structure of MDC1 and NBS1. The red segment indicates the N-terminal region of MDC1 (amino acids 1&#x2013;1,100) subjected to progressive deletion and interaction analysis with NBS1. (C) The N-terminal region of MDC1 spanning the first 500 amino acids efficiently interacts with cellular NBS1. The indicated HA-tagged fragments of the MDC1 N terminus were transfected into MDC1/shRNA cells (the numbers indicate the C-terminal amino acid of each fragment). After 24 h, lysates were prepared, subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody, and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to NBS1 (top) and HA (middle). The input into each reaction was controlled by NBS1 immunoblotting of the whole cell extracts as in A (bottom). (D) Efficient knockdown of endogenous MDC1. Lysates from U2OS cells and its derivative in which MDC1 is knocked down by stably integrated shRNA (MDC1/shRNA) were analyzed by immunoblotting with an MDC1-specific antibody (top). The NBS1 immunoblot serves as a loading control and indicates that the overall levels of NBS1 are not affected by the MDC1 knockdown (bottom). (E) The FHA domain of NBS1 interacts with the MDC1 N terminus. MDC1/shRNA cells were cotransfected with the HA-tagged MDC1 N terminus (p1100) and the following Myc-tagged variants of NBS1: WT (wild type), R28 (nonfunctional FHA domain), &#x394;C (C-terminal deletion without the MRE11 and ATM interaction domains), and 3A (alanine substitutions of serines 278, 343, and 397, the ATM phosphorylation sites). After 24 h, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc (top) and anti-HA (middle) antibodies. The bottom panel is an immunoblot of whole cell extracts and shows the input of each of the Myc-tagged NBS1 proteins.

To this end, we coexpressed the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of MDC1 spanning the first 1,100 amino acids (p1100) with various Myc-tagged variants of NBS1 and assessed their interaction by an immunoprecipitation assay. Consistent with a previous study that measured the interaction of NBS1 mutants with full-length MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>), we found that a point mutation within the NBS1-FHA domain (NBS1<sup>R28</sup>) completely uncoupled NBS1 from the MDC1 N terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, neither disruption of the NBS1 C terminus responsible for interaction with MRE11 and ATM (NBS1<sup>&#x394;C</sup>) nor mutation of the three major phosphorylation sites targeted by the ATM kinase (NBS1<sup>3A</sup>) had a measurable effect, and these mutants interacted with the MDC1 fragment as efficiently as the wild-type (WT) NBS1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the MDC1 N terminus contains the necessary structural signature to allow recognition of MDC1 by the FHA domain of NBS1.</p></sec><sec><title>The SDT-rich region in the MDC1 N terminus mediates interaction with NBS1</title><p>Next, we subjected the N-terminal fragment of MDC1 to a bioinformatic analysis and searched for conserved motifs that may potentially mediate the interaction with NBS1. Interestingly, the region between amino acids 210 and 460 (that is, the part of MDC1 identified in the previous section as necessary and sufficient to bind NBS1) contained up to six acidic SDT motifs, some of which are conserved among different vertebrate species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708210/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708210/DC1</ext-link>). To test whether the SDT clusters influence the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction, we generated another set of MDC1 fragments either spanning different parts of the SDT-containing region or harboring an in-frame deletion of the entire SDT region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The fragment containing all six SDT repeats efficiently bound to endogenous NBS1 when expressed in the U2OS/shRNA cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, lane 4). Strikingly, even shorter fragments containing either three N-terminal (SDT1) or four C-terminal (SDT2) repeats still interacted with NBS1, albeit with a lower efficiency than the full-length SDT region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Conversely, deletion of the entire SDT region completely abolished the ability of the MDC1 N terminus to bind NBS1 under these conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, lane 3). Together, these data indicate that the SDT repeats within the MDC1 N terminus might be involved in binding to NBS1, and we set out to further explore this possibility.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The SDT-rich region within the MDC1 N terminus promotes MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction.</bold> (A) The N-terminal part of MDC1 delineated by amino acids 218 and 455 contains six acidophilic Ser-Thr-Asp (SDT) repeats.

To test this important prediction, we analyzed phosphorylation patterns of various forms of MDC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) immunopurified from U2OS cells metabolically labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate. As expected, the tryptic phosphopeptide map of endogenous MDC1 revealed considerable complexity, indicating that numerous phosphorylation events converge on these large adaptor proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Strikingly, the majority of the phosphopeptide spots observed in the endogenous protein were preserved in the N-terminal fragment of MDC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), and some of the most prominent spots were clearly also resolved in the isolated SDT region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Indeed, a systematic analysis of various deletion fragments and/or the SDT mutants in which the Ser/Thr residues were substituted to Ala confirmed that at least four of the prominent SDT clusters are subjected to phosphorylation in vivo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). A typical example of such an assay is provided in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (F and G)</xref>, where mutation of the second (amino acids 299/301) or the sixth (amino acids 453/455) SDT repeat eliminated the respective prominently labeled spot.

Efficient phosphorylation of the WT (but not the 12A) SDT fragment was confirmed by a marked mobility shift on the SDS gel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, bottom). Strikingly, only the CK2-phosphorylated but not the unmodified SDT region interacted with NBS1 in this in vitro binding assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 3). Importantly, this interaction required the intact FHA domain of NBS1, as the R28 mutant of NBS1 failed to bind to the MDC1 N terminus even though this was efficiently phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 8). The SDT-12A mutant did not bind to any form of NBS1 under these conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10).</p><p>To explore the emerging cross talk between CK2 and the N terminus of MDC1, we tested the impact of CK2 inhibition on SDT phosphorylation in cells. Indeed, preincubation of U2OS cells with a CK2 inhibitor significantly reduced the overall incorporation of radioactive phosphate to the ectopically expressed SDT fragment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). More importantly in this context, the ensuing phosphopeptide analysis revealed that this was accompanied by an &#x223C;50% reduction of phosphate incorporation into two prominent SDT repeats (Ser299/Thr301 and Ser453/Ser455; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, CK2 can at least partially phosphorylate the SDT repeats in vivo.

The isolated mutations of the Ser/Thr residues within the second (amino acids 299/301) or the sixth (amino acids 453/455) SDT cluster had only marginal effects, and these mutants bound NBS1 almost as efficiently as the WT MDC1 N terminus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, lanes 1&#x2013;3). Strikingly, a combination of these mutations (designated as 4A) markedly impaired the ability to bind NBS1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, lane 4), and mutation of the Ser/Thr residues in all six SDT clusters (12A) abolished the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction completely (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, lane 5). Thus, consistent with the in vitro binding experiments described in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the integrity of the SDT repeats appears to be critical to support the interaction between MDC1 and NBS1 in cells.

To this end, we again used the U2OS-derived cell line with stably depleted endogenous MDC1 (MDC1/shRNA; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To test the suitability of this cellular model for the in vivo reconstitution experiments with heterologous MDC1 alleles, we first confirmed that the endogenous MDC1 in these cells was indeed down-regulated to the degree that prevented any cytologically discernible accumulation of NBS1 in the laser-generated DSB tracks (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708210/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708210/DC1</ext-link>). We then reconstituted this cell line with WT MDC1 or the phosphorylation-deficient variants in which the Ser and Thr residues were mutated in two (4A) or in all six (12A) SDT repeats. All of these MDC1 variants were generated in the context of full-length proteins, tagged with the HA epitope on the N terminus, and rendered insensitive to shRNA. Strikingly, although the WT and both phosphorylation-deficient forms of MDC1 avidly accumulated at the DSB-flanking chromatin, only the WT version was able to fully restore the retention of NBS1 in this compartment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, left). In contrast, cells expressing the MDC1-4A mutant retained only residual amounts of NBS1 at the DSB-modified chromatin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, middle), and MDC1-12A completely failed to support any cytologically discernible accumulation of NBS1 in these regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, right). Importantly, these cell-based data closely matched the progressive loss of MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interactions in the pull-down assay using the analogous MDC1 phosphodeficient mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, compare lanes 1, 4, and 5). Together, these data suggest that the SDT-associated phosphorylations trigger productive interaction between MDC1 and NBS1 and facilitate retention of the latter protein at the DSB-modified chromatin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results elucidate the nature of one of the most proximal steps in the spatiotemporal evolution of DSB-modified chromatin. Specifically, although availability of the MDC1 adaptor protein and the NBS1-FHA domain were known to regulate MRN chromatin retention, the way these two factors communicate with each other remained elusive. Our findings mechanistically explain this conundrum by identifying the conserved SDT repeats in the MDC1 N terminus and by showing that their phosphorylation generates recognition sites for the NBS1-FHA domain. In addition, we identify CK2 as a candidate kinase that can phosphorylate the SDT repeats and show that the integrity of the SDT-associated phosphoacceptor residues is required for MRN retention at the sites of DNA damage.</p><p>At first glance, it appears surprising that CK2, a ubiquitous and constitutively active kinase, regulates MDC1, a protein that functions almost exclusively in stochastic events triggered by genotoxic stress in which it operates strictly locally at the sites of chromosomal lesions. To comprehend this seemingly unusual cross talk, it is important to realize that MDC1 and NBS1 interact already in unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>), and, as we show in this study, even this predamage interaction is at least partly regulated by CK2. Based on this observation, the first obvious scenario that comes to mind is that as a result of its constitutive phosphorylation by CK2, MDC1 forms a stable holocomplex with MRN. In this model, the MRN focus formation simply reflects the propensity of MDC1 (as a fourth subunit of the MRN complex) to avidly interact with &#x3B3;-H2AX. Although simple and attractive, several pieces of evidence suggest a more subtle way of regulation. First, MRN clearly has functions that do not require MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petrini and Stracker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri et al., 2006</xref>), and a strong affinity trap on SDT-phosphorylated MDC1 would likely reduce MRN's flexibility and limit its accessibility to nuclear compartments where it operates independently of MDC1. Indeed, kinetic analysis of NBS1 and MDC1 mobility in living cells revealed marked differences between these two proteins: although both NBS1 and MDC1 become retained at the DSB sites (a feature that determines formation of the cytologically discernible nuclear foci), the residence time of MDC1 at DSBs was nearly one order of magnitude longer compared with NBS1. As a result, although MDC1 becomes immobilized at the DSB-flanking chromatin, NBS1 remains highly mobile, a feature compatible with its flexible exchange among distinct DSB-generated subcompartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lukas et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2004a</xref>). Thus, the interaction between MDC1 and NBS1 is dynamic, and these two factors do not appear to form a rigid holocomplex.</p><p>Given these findings, the new data presented in this study, and similar results reached by Spycher et al. (see p. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="181" page="227" id="N0x1d85ed0N0x4032070" xlink:href="18411308" ext-link-type="pubmed">227</related-article> of this issue), our current model describing the mechanism of MRN chromatin retention is as follows. In undamaged nuclei (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, top), CK2 phosphorylates the SDT repeats of MDC1. Combined with the ability of the NBS1-FHA domain to recognize phosphorylated SDTs, this allows constitutive yet highly dynamic MDC1&#x2013;MRN interaction, which remains amenable to further regulation and prevents sequestration of any of these factors in rigid aggregates. The latter feature could be crucial to allow the rapid recognition of DNA breaks by the MRN complex, a process that is independent of MDC1 (see Introduction). After DSB generation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, bottom), the most proximal chromatin modification includes phosphorylation of the H2AX C terminus (&#x3B3;-H2AX). Although several DSB regulators contain phosphate interaction motifs and domains, the MDC1-BRCT domain appears to interact with &#x3B3;-H2AX with the highest affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stucki et al., 2005</xref>), resulting in a rapid coating of the &#x3B3;-H2AX&#x2013;primed chromatin by MDC1. At this point, the MDC1 N terminus becomes important for the ensuing events on the DSB-flanking chromatin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, bottom). We propose that constitutive phosphorylation of the SDT repeats (translated to a continuous generation of binding sites for the NBS1-FHA domain) is likely the most efficient means to avoid any delay in recruiting MRN to the modified chromatin rapidly evolving around the incipient DBS lesions. Indeed, integration of a constitutive signal is consistent with the simultaneous recruitment of MDC1 and NBS1 to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukas et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>) and suggests that in vertebrates, the SDT repeats of MDC1 coevolved with MRN to prime the latter for the fastest possible arrival at the sites of harmful chromosomal lesions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>A hypothetical model of the MDC1&#x2013;MRN interaction before and after DNA damage.</bold> In undamaged cells, CK2 targets the SDT-rich N terminus of MDC1. Phosphorylated SDTs are recognized by the FHA domain of NBS1 and allow dynamic interaction between MDC1 and the MRN complex (top). DSBs trigger the phosphorylation of H2AX (middle) followed by its recognition by the MDC1-associated BRCT domains (bottom). The resulting concentration of phosphorylated SDT repeated in the DSB-flanking chromatin allows immediate recruitment of the MRN complex to this compartment. CK2 (potentially together with another acidophilic kinase; indicated by an asterisk) may then stimulate MRN retention at the DSB sites by phosphorylating additional SDT repeats. Alternatively, the SDT-associated phosphates might be stabilized by inhibition of a DSB-associated protein phosphatase (PPase). Both mechanisms are compatible with a dynamic MRN exchange between distinct DSB-generated subcompartments but prevent its dilution in the undamaged nucleoplasm. See Discussion for an additional explanation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810213f08"/></fig><p>Although our data and the complementary results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spycher et al. (2008)</xref> strongly implicate CK2 in phosphorylating the MDC1 N terminus, we cannot exclude the possibility that other acidophilic kinases contribute to regulate the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction. Most notably in this regard, we show in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> that chemical inhibition of CK2 reduced but did not abolish phosphorylation of the prominently phosphorylated SDT repeats (the maximum reduction of phosphate incorporation to these repeats was &#x223C;50% compared with CK2-proficient cells). Unlike complete genetic disruption of the dominant SDT repeats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>), this degree of the SDT phosphorylation impairment was not sufficient to prevent accumulation of NBS1 at the DSB sites (our unpublished data).</p><p>As alluded to in the preceding paragraphs of this section, this model poses an important conceptual question: how is constitutive and ubiquitous phosphorylation of the MDC1 N terminus transformed to a signal that locally and transiently enhances chromatin affinity for NBS1? The answer to this question is not trivial, but several scenarios come to mind (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, bottom). First, it is possible that just the sheer increase in the local density of MDC1 (and the corresponding phosphates on the SDT repeats) may be sufficient to delay MRN at the DSBs to an extent that still allows its dynamic exchange between distinct DSB-generated subcompartments yet prevents its dilution in the undamaged parts of the nucleus. Second, although CK2 activity does not increase after DNA damage, one can envisage that DSBs may locally regulate (inhibit) chromatin-associated phosphatases and thereby decrease the rate of SDT-phosphate turnover. In principle, this may also increase local density of phosphorylated SDT repeats and thereby stabilize the interaction between the MDC1 N terminus and the NBS1-FHA domain. Third, an alternative (but not mutually exclusive) model is based on our observation that the MDC1 N terminus harbors a cluster of six SDT sites and that at least some of them contribute to the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction in a cooperative fashion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, it is possible that although only a subset of the SDT repeats generates the basal level of MDC1&#x2013;MRN interaction in undamaged cells, the DSB-associated MDC1 undergoes additional conformational changes in its N terminus that may allow phosphorylation of the entire SDT region and, thereby, locally increase the interaction platform for NBS1 and indeed the entire MRN complex. Further studies will be required to discriminate among these scenarios.</p><p>Finally, we note that the role of CK2 in the DNA damage response is not unprecedented. The most striking parallel with our findings has been provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loizou et al. (2004)</xref>, who reported that CK2 phosphorylates XRCC1, an adaptor protein involved in single-strand DNA break repair. This and the subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clements et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanno et al., 2007</xref>) showed that CK2-mediated phosphorylation was required for the interaction of XRCC1 with other repair proteins such as polynucleotide kinase, aprataxin, and XIP1 (the latter protein is also known as APLF and PALF, respectively). It is noteworthy that all of these proteins interacted with XRCC1 by their FHA domains, which is in striking analogy to the MDC1&#x2013;NBS1 interaction described in this study. In addition, an exciting conceptual parallel between the CK2-XRCC1 and CK2-MDC1 interplay is provided by the fact that in both cases, CK2 targets large scaffold proteins that by themselves do not posses enzymatic activity but rather appear to integrate upstream signaling to organize other proteins at the vicinity of DNA lesions. The fact that CK2 targets different adaptor proteins engaged in distinct DNA repair processes (single-strand breaks and DSBs) suggests that phosphorylation of these molecular adaptors coevolved to increase the efficiency of the genome surveillance machinery. Although the recent genetic data strongly support the role of MRN chromatin retention for survival and genomic stability after DSB-generating insults (see Introduction), the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of XRCC1 facilitates the single-stranded break repair by promoting the recruitment of polynucleotide kinase and aprataxin and by protecting XIP1 from proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clements et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loizou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanno et al., 2007</xref>). When combined together, the previous findings and our new data support the emerging model that one important function of CK2 is to increase the efficiency of genome surveillance by targeting interaction matchmakers and thereby promoting the local concentration and/or stability of DNA damage regulators at sites of genetic lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and gene transfer</title><p>The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in DME (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin.
