      <abstract>
        <p>Although previous studies have proposed plausible mechanisms of the activation of transforming growth factor-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in inflammatory signals, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), its activating kinase still remains to be unclear. In the present study, we have provided evidences that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 has a pivotal role for activating TAK1, and thereby regulate NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent gene expressions in inflammatory signaling mediated by TLR4 and TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> stimulation. AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 specifically interacts with TAK1 and reciprocally regulates their kinase activities. Upon the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown (AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>) or TAK1-knockdown human monocytic THP-1 cells exhibit a dramatic reduction in the TAK1 or AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 kinase activity, respectively, and subsequent suppressions of its downstream signaling cascades, which further leads to inhibitions of NF-&#x3BA;B and thereby productions of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, and IL-6. Importantly, the microarray analysis of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> cells revealed a dramatic reduction in the NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes induced by TLR4 and TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> stimulation, and the observation was in significant correlation with the results of quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> cells are highly sensitive to the TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis, which is accompanied with dramatic reductions in the NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent and anti-apoptotic genes. As a result, our data demonstrate that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 as an activating kinase of TAK1 has a key role in mediating inflammatory signals triggered by TLR4 and TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>.</p>

    <p>Transforming growth factor-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> (TGF-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family and a serine/threonine protein kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> TAK1 functions as an upstream signaling molecule of NF-&#x3BA;B and MAPKs in proinflammatory signals transduced by TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to TLR4 causes recruitment of MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 to the receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The TRAF6 catalyzes synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that serve as a scaffold to recruit the TAK1 and I&#x3BA;B kinase (IKK) complexes. Recruitment of the kinase complexes facilitates autophosphorylation of TAK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IKK<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> by TAK1, leading to I&#x3BA;B degradation and subsequent activation of NF-&#x3BA;B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Despite of the plausible mechanisms by which TAK1 is activated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> the existence of a specific upstream kinase of TAK1 in the signaling cascades is still ambiguous.</p>
    <p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has emerged as a master sensor of cellular energy balance in mammalian cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The AMPK protein exists as a heterotrimer composed of a 63-kDa catalytic (<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>) subunit and two non-catalytic regulatory subunits, <italic>&#x3B2;</italic> (30&#x2009;kDa) and <italic>&#x3B3;</italic> (38&#x2013;63&#x2009;kDa). There are several isoforms for each of the three AMPK subunits, including <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>2, <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>1, <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>2, <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>1, <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>2, and <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The two AMPK<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> variants, <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 and <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>2, have been shown to have a differential localization pattern in mammalian cells, with the AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 subunit being localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>2 subunit localized in the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In terms of cell type specificity, most of the cells express both AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>2 isoforms, whereas lymphcytes only express the AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 isoform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> A previous report has addressed the relationship between T-cell receptor-mediated signaling and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKK)-dependent pathway, implying that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 may have specific roles in immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Here, we demonstrate that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 has a pivotal role in inducing proinflammatory signals, such as TLR4 and TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, through the activation of TAK1. The knockdown of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 results in the marked reduction of TAK1 activity, and thereby suppressions of downstream signaling cascades and the expression of NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes in response to LPS stimulation, indicating an AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-TAK1-NF-&#x3BA;B axis in TLR4-mediated signaling. Moreover, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown cells are highly sensitive to TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis, supporting the functional role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 associated with expressions of anti-apoptotic genes regulated by the TAK1-induced NF-&#x3BA;B activity. Thus, our results suggest that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 may be one of the upstream kinases capable of inducing the activation of TAK1 in proinflammatory signals.</p>

</italic>1 activity attenuates TLR4-mediated signaling pathway</title>
        <p>Previous reports have demonstrated the functional relationship between AMPK and TAK1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> however, the functional role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 has not yet been elucidated in innate signal. Therefore, we have explored this issue in human monocytic THP-1 cells with a TLR4 agonist, LPS. To know whether LPS stimulation induces the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, because it has been known that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, but not AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>2, is solely expressed in human monocytic cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> THP-1 cells were treated with LPS for different time intervals and then the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 was evaluated with anti-pho-AMPK antibody. The phosphorylation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 was gradually increased by LPS treatment in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). To further examine whether AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is either a positive or negative regulator in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway, leading to activate NF-&#x3BA;B and activator protein 1 (AP-1), THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of compound C, which is a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Both NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1 reporter activities induced by LPS were significantly reduced in compound C-treated THP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, NF-&#x3BA;B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, AP-1). Furthermore, the inhibition of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 activity resulted in a dramatic reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, induced by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, IL-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>). We next attempted to verify the specific function of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 in terms of its kinase activity. For this, we constructed dominant negative (DN), AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 (D159A), and constitutive active (CA), AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 (T174D), forms of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, and examined their functional roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type (wt) AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 slightly enhanced the activities of both, NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1, in the presence or absence of LPS stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g and h</xref>, closed bar), whereas AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 (D159A) DN significantly suppressed these activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g and h</xref>, chute-block bar). In contrast, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 (T174D) CA induced increase in the activities of NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g and h</xref>, hatched bar). Consistent with the above-mentioned findings, similar results in the production of inflammatory cytokines were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, IL-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>). These results suggest that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 may be positively involved in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>The autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 interacts with N-terminus of TAK1, and that reciprocally regulate their activations</title>
        <p>We next explored the molecular mechanism by which AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is involved in TLR4-mediated signaling. Previous reports have shown that TAK1 is involved in the activation of AMPK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> We raised a possibility of the functional regulation between TAK1 and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 serine/threonine protein kinase. We first tested the molecular interaction between AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 and TAK1. The overexpressed TAK1 was significantly co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, and the interaction was enhanced by LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, lane 4 <italic>versus</italic> lane 5). To identify the interaction domain in each other, TAK1 or AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 truncated mutants were constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), and then immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Overexpressed AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with all the truncated TAK1 construct, indicating that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 interacts with TAK1 through the N-terminus of TAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, TAK1 specifically interacted with the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 (312&#x2013;392) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To verify the <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction, we further performed endogenous immunoprecipication assay. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction, endogenous TAK1 was specifically coprecipitated with endogenous AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, and the interaction was significantly enhanced in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, lane 1 <italic>versus</italic> lane 2). These results suggest that the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 interacts with the N-terminus of TAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We next explored whether AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is directly able to activate TAK1 in response to LPS stimulation. To find an answer for our query, we generated knockdown THP-1 cells against AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 and TAK1 protein by using siRNA-contained lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Interestingly, phosphorylations of Thr172/174 and Ser 485 of APK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 were markedly reduced and the phosphorylation of TAK1 was dramatically reduced in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown (AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>) THP-1 cells treated with LPS as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>). Interestingly, TAK1-knockdown (TAK1<sup>KD</sup>) cells exhibited marked reduction in phosphorylation of Thr172/174 and Ser 485 of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, TAK1<sup>KD</sup>). It was partly consistent with the previous report that TAK1 is involved in the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Consistent with the result, the kinase activity of TAK1 or AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 induced by LPS stimulation was also significantly reduced in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> or TAK1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells, respectively, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, TAK1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1). These results strongly demonstrate that the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 interacts with N-terminus of TAK1, which further reciprocally regulates their kinase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>

Basal activities of NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1 were significantly decreased in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>, closed bars). Their activity were markedly increased in LPS-treated wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>, doted bars), moreover, significantly enhanced in wt-AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-expressed wt THP-1 stimulated with LPS, as compared with that of unstimulated wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>, chute-block bar). To gain further direct evidence on whether AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signal, we performed the rescue experiment in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells. The wt AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 vector was transfected in the AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells. The AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells transfected with AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 vector were treated with or without LPS. Interestingly, the activities of NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1 were markedly recovered, as compared with that of mock transfectant AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref> in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>, dotted bar <italic>versus</italic> chute-block bar). Given these results, we further assessed DNA-binding activities of NF-&#x3BA;B, p65 and p50, and AP-1, c-fos and c-jun. Consistently, overexpressions of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 in wt THP-1 markedly enhanced DNA-binding activities of p65, p50, c-fos, and c-jun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, p65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, p50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, c-fos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, c-jun). Furthermore, these DNA-binding activities were significantly increased in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-transfected AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, p65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, p50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, c-fos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, c-jun), indicating a positive role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 in TLR4-mediated signaling. Based on the functional role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 in TLR4-mediated activations of NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1, we next assessed regulations of signaling molecules, which appear in the TLR4-mediated signaling cascades. For this, wt THP-1 and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells were treated with or without LPS for different times. As expected, the phosphorylation of TAK1 was markedly attenuated in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, pho-TAK1). Interestingly, phosphorylations of other downstream signaling molecules, such as p-38, JNK, and AKT, were also significantly decreased in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). These results were partly consistent with previous reports that AMPK has an important role in promoting activations of p38 MAPK, JNK, and AKT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Moreover, we found that a marked reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, and IL-6, induced by LPS stimulation could be detected in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>).

        <p>To validate the axis of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-TAK1-NF-&#x3BA;B in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway in a detailed manner, we performed gene expression analysis. According to stimulation of LPS, marked changes in gene expression profiles could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). To assess the NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent gene expressions by LPS stimulation, 94 genes containing specific &#x3BA;B-binding DNA sequences were further sorted out. Expression levels of 94 genes were significantly altered in either wt or AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells by treatment with or without LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). According to the relative up and down expressions in each combination, 36 genes were selected, and were subdivided into two groups: group 1, highly regulated genes such as IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, IL-8, CD44, TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, and CCL-5; and group 2, moderately regulated genes such as NF-KB1, NF-KB1A, NF-KB1E, RELB, IER3, REL, and BCL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1b</xref>). To verify their expression, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with specific primers targeted to each gene. Both group 1 and group 2 genes were greatly upregulated in LPS-treated wt THP-1 cells, as compared with that of without stimulation, whereas minute changes could be detected in LPS-treated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells, as compared with that of without stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, group 1 gene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, group 2 gene). These results strongly support that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is positively involved in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway through the activation of TAK1, and thereby regulates TLR4-mediated NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent gene expression.</p>

As expected, apoptotic cell death induced by TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> was markedly increased in TAK1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a and b</xref>, 9&#xB1;2% in mock without TNF-<italic>&#x3B1; versus</italic> 23&#xB1;4% in mock with TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>), whereas the apoptosis was significantly decreased in TAK1-overexpressed TAK1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>MEF cells than in the case of mock transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, 23&#xB1;4% in mock with TNF-<italic>&#x3B1; versus</italic> 10&#xB1;3% in TAK1 with TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>). Interestingly, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells were highly sensitive to TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, wt THP-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>). To verify the results, we performed caspase activity and DNA laddering assay in the same condition. Consistently, the activities of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 8 were markedly higher in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells than that in wt THP-1 cells activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, caspase 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, caspase 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, caspase 8). Moreover, similar results could be seen in DNA laddering assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).

        <p>TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> signaling is transduced through its receptors to simultaneously elicit two opposing effects: the induction of apoptosis and the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> We therefore examined whether the effects of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 on TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis are linked to the expression of NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes and pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic genes; we performed gene expression analysis of wt and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> THP-1 cells with or without TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> stimulation, respectively. According to stimulation of TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, marked changes in gene expression profiles could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).

        <p>We further assessed whether the sensitivity on TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> cells is associated with the gene expression profiles related to apoptosis. According to stimulation of TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, marked changes in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression profiles could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables 3a, 3b and 4a, 4b</xref>). To verify these gene expression profiles, we selected four different pro-apoptotic genes, such as <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>LTA</italic>, <italic>MAGED1</italic>, and <italic>TNFRFS21</italic>, and four different anti-apoptotic genes, such as <italic>SGK1</italic>, <italic>PI3KCB</italic>, <italic>BCL2L2</italic>, and <italic>BCL2</italic>, and performed qRT-PCR analysis. The pro-apoptotic genes were markedly increased in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup> cells non-treated with TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1<sup>KD</sup>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our experiments demonstrate that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 critically regulates TLR4-mediated signaling pathway through the activation of TAK1. We found that autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 interacts with the N-terminus of TAK1. The masking of autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 seems to be critically associated with the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 by TAK1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> which led us to speculate that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 might regulate the activity of TAK1 through the intermolecular interaction. In terms of the activity of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, the inhibition of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 activity with a pharmacological compound, compound C, revealed a dramatic reduction in NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1 activities, and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, we found that a constitutive active form of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 significantly augmented these activities induced by LPS treatment, but not in a DN form as AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1. These results suggest that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is functionally involved in TLR4-mediated signaling through the molecular interaction with TAK1.</p>
      <p>The TAK1 was originally identified as a TGF-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-activated kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The TAK1 is involved in distinct cellular signals such as Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, activin, and TGF-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In addition, TAK1 has a major role in both innate and adaptive immunity pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> We found that, in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells, TAK1 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in response to LPS stimulation when compared with that of wt THP-1 cells. In agreement with previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> phosphorylations of JNK, p38, and AKT were impaired in LPS-treated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells, indicating that AMPK has an important role in promoting p38, JNK, AKT activations. Furthermore, DNA-binding activities of p65, p50, c-Fos, and c-Jun were markedly reduced in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells. In AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells, dramatic reductions in TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> could be detected in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, microarray and qRT-PCR analysis targeted to NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes critically revealed marked reductions of the expression of these genes in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells after LPS treatment. These results strongly support the hypothesis that AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is critically required for TLR4-mediated signaling, thus leading to activation of NF-&#x3BA;B and AP-1, and thereby regulating expressions of NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes.</p>
      <p>To verify the functional role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 capable of regulating TAK1 activity, we confirmed the effects in another system, TFN-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that TAK1 has a protective role against TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis through the activation of NF-&#x3BA;B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Interestingly, AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown cells were highly sensitive to TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis along with a marked reduction in the levels of NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes as compared with those of wt THP-1 cells. When we analyzed the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and pro-apoptotic genes in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown or wt THP-1 cells after TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> treatment, furthermore, marked inductions of pro-apoptotic genes could be detected, whereas significant reductions in anti-apoptotic genes could be detected in AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1-knockdown THP-1 cells. These results were similar to that of TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis in TAK1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>MEF cells. Therefore, the obtained results support a pivotal role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1, which eventually lead to express NF-&#x3BA;B-dependent genes related in the protection to TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-induced apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Although it is not completely understood as how TAK1 activity is biochemically regulated, its activation seems to require TAK1-binding proteins such as TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3. In addition, a plausible model about how to activate TAK1 in innate signaling has been proposed in a recent report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Binding of IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> to IL-1R or LPS to TLR4 causes recruitment of adopter proteins such as MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 to the receptor. The TRAF6 in turn catalyzes synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The polyubiquitin chains acts as a scaffold motif to recruit the TAK1 and IKK complexes through binding to the regulatory subunits TAB2 and NEMO, respectively. Recruitment of the kinase complexes facilitates autophosphorylation of TAK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IKK<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> by TAK1, thus leading to I&#x3BA;B degradation and subsequent activation of NF-&#x3BA;B. Our data propose a potential possibility that TAK1 activity in both TLR4- and TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-mediated signaling pathway may be regulated by AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1. Taken together, our data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Binding of LPS derived from bacterial components to TLR4 initiates intracellular-signaling cascades, initially leading to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as MyD88, IRAKs, and Mal proteins. Two critical events for the activation of TAK1 may occur in the middle of signaling cascades. Upon the TLR4 stimulation, the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is simultaneously induced by LKB1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and then activated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 can induce activation of JNK/p38MAPK pathway, thereby inducing activations of AP-1 components such as c-Jun and c-fos. Simultaneously, activated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 specifically interacts with TAK1 through the molecular interaction between N-terminus of TAK1 and autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, and subsequently induces the phosphorylation of TAK1 for the activation. In turn, the activated TAK1 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of IKK<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, leading to I&#x3BA;B degradation and activation of NF-&#x3BA;B. Nevertheless, the existence of other upstream kinases capable of inducing TAK1 activation and the reciprocal regulation between TAK1 and AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is not completely ruled out. Therefore, future studies elucidating the specific molecular mechanism may contribute towards more detailed understanding on the functional roles played by TAK1 as a key element kinase in different innate signaling pathways.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers' protocol. After processing with DNase digestion, and clean-up procedures, RNA samples were quantified, aliquoted, and stored at &#x2212;80&#x2009;&#xB0;C until use. For quality control, RNA purity and integrity were evaluated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, OD 260/280 ratio, and analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA was amplified and purified using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to yield biotinylated cRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 550&#x2009;ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, and labeled with biotin-NTP. After purification, the cRNA was quantified using the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, NC, USA). Typically, 750&#x2009;ng of labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to each humanHT-12 expression v.4 bead array for 16&#x2013;18&#x2009;h at 58&#x2009;&#xB0;C, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Detection of array signal was carried out using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) following the bead array manual. Arrays were scanned with an Illumina bead array Reader confocal scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions. For raw data preparation and statistical analysis, the quality of hybridization and overall chip performance were monitored by visual inspection of both internal quality control checks and the raw scanned data. Raw data were extracted using the software provided by the manufacturer (Illumina GenomeStudio v2009.2 (Gene Expression Module v1.5.4)). Array data were filtered by detection of <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 (similar to signal to noise) in at least 50% samples (we applied a filtering criterion for data analysis; higher signal value was required to obtain a detection <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05). Selected gene signal value was transformed by logarithm and normalized by quantile method. The comparative analysis between test sample and control sample was carried out using fold change. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using complete linkage and Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity. GO-ontology analysis for significant probe list was performed using PANTHER (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/ontologies.jsp">http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/ontologies.jsp</ext-link>), using text files containing Gene ID list and accession number of illumina probe ID. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to check whether the <italic>a priori</italic> defined set of genes shows a differential pattern in both the biological process and the molecular function states. One-tail Fisher Exact was adopted to measure the gene enrichment in annotation terms. All the data analysis and visualization of differentially expressed genes was conducted using R 2.4.1(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Schematic model showing role of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1 in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. Binding of LPS derived from bacterial components to TLR4 initiates intracellular signaling cascades, initially leading to the recruitment of adapter molecules such as MyD88, IRAKs, and Mal proteins. Two critical events for the activation of TAK1 may occur in the middle of signaling cascades. Upon TLR4 stimulation, the activation of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 is simultaneously induced by LKB1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and then activated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 can induce activation of JNK/p38MAPK pathway, thereby inducing activations of AP-1 components such as c-Jun and c-fos. Simultaneously, activated AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 specifically interacts with TAK1 through the molecular interaction between N-terminus of TAK1 and autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1, and then AMPK-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>1 and TAK1 reciprocally induces phosphorylations of TAK1 for the activation. In turn, the activated TAK1 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of IKK<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, leading to I&#x3BA;B degradation and activation of NF-&#x3BA;B. Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, and IL-6 are expressed</p>
